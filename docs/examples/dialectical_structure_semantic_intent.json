This is a DIALECTICAL DIAGRAM showing how contradictions drive transformation.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. Show THESIS → ANTITHESIS → SYNTHESIS movement with clear directional flow\n2. Mark CONTRADICTIONS as genuine incompatibilities (not just differences)\n3. Show SYNTHESIS as containing/preserving elements of both thesis and antithesis (not as a compromise or middle ground)\n4. Use VERTICAL or SPIRAL arrangement to show dialectical progression to higher levels\n5. Distinguish RESOLVED contradictions (synthesized) from UNRESOLVED tensions (still active)\n6. Identify the FOUNDATIONAL CONTRADICTION that drives the whole dialectic\n\nWHAT NOT TO DO:\n- Do NOT create a static map of positions without movement\n- Do NOT show thesis and antithesis as simply 'different views'\n- Do NOT make synthesis look like averaging or compromise\n- Do NOT use a flat radial layout - dialectics has levels/progression\n- Do NOT omit the dynamic, transformational aspect\n\nThe goal: Someone looking at this should SEE the dialectical movement - how contradictions generate new positions, which syntheses resolve which tensions, and where contradictions remain active.",
