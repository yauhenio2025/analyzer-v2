  label: Comprehensive Foundations — Summary & Idea Genealogies
  description: |-
    Exhaustive foundational work establishing the empirical base for
    the genealogical synthesis. Compose executive summary distilling
    all upstream evidence into dominant influences, key evolution
    patterns, and surprising findings. Trace idea genealogies for
    every significant concept: detailed timelines (work, year, form
    of the idea at each stage) with textual evidence, and evolution
    narratives explaining key transformations and their significance.
    Identify co-evolution patterns showing how changing one idea
    forced changes to others. Rank key findings by significance with
    multi-audience implications. These two outputs — summary and idea
    genealogies — are independent and provide the factual base for
    the narrative synthesis in subsequent passes.

  label: Genealogical Portrait & Intellectual Character
  description: |-
    With the factual foundations from the discovery pass, construct the
    structural narrative. Compose the genealogical portrait: a sustained
    analytical narrative tracing the author's intellectual trajectory
    through Nietzschean descent (herkunft) and emergence (entstehung).
    The narrative should map origin stories, key transformation moments
    with close textual analysis, abandoned paths with hypothesized
    reasons, and the current work's position as both culmination and
    new departure. Compose the intellectual character profile: recurring
    intellectual moves, characteristic strengths, persistent weaknesses,
    debt-handling patterns (generous acknowledgment, strategic concealment,
    genuine oversight), and assessment of growth versus entrenchment over
    time. Compare to other thinkers with similar intellectual profiles
    where illuminating.

  label: Comprehensive Genealogical Synthesis
  description: |-
    Comprehensive synthesis integrating all prior pass outputs into a
    unified deliverable. At surface depth, this is the only pass and
    must produce executive summary, key findings, and brief genealogical
    portrait from all available upstream data. At standard and deep
    depths, this pass integrates findings from discovery and architecture
    passes: reflexive methodological assessment examining biases in the
    genealogical method itself, per-finding confidence assessments with
    evidence quality evaluations, comprehensive inventory of limitations,
    all relationship classification revisions with reasons, and detailed
    follow-up research agenda. Final revision of executive summary and
    key findings in light of the full narrative synthesis. Assessment
    of how the author might respond to each finding.
