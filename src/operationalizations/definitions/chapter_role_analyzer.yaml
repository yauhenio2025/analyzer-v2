  label: Structural Discovery
  description: |-
    Discover the structural landscape: classify every chapter's functional
    role (foundation, development, evidence, objection handling, synthesis,
    methodology, context, conclusion), track where key concepts are
    introduced and how they flow across chapters, and map the inter-part
    dynamics if the work has parts or major sections. Be exhaustive —
    don't just classify the obvious chapters; even transitional or
    seemingly peripheral chapters serve functions that the architecture
    pass will need to understand.

  label: Dependency and Coupling Architecture
  description: |-
    With chapter roles classified, build the dependency and coupling
    architecture. Map what each chapter requires from upstream chapters
    (conceptual prerequisites, empirical foundations, methodological
    setups) and what it provides downstream. Assess coupling: which
    chapters are tightly bound (can't be understood in isolation) and
    which are loosely coupled (could be reordered)? Identify dialectical
    pairs, complementary groups, and standalone excursus chapters.
    This architecture is the structural skeleton of the argument —
    it reveals the critical path through the text.

  label: Vulnerability Confrontation
  description: |-
    Confront the structural architecture with critical scrutiny. Where
    are the vulnerabilities? Load-bearing chapters that are underdeveloped
    — chapters that the entire argument depends on but that provide thin
    argumentation. Missing bridges — places where the text leaps from
    one section to another without adequate connection. Circular
    dependencies — arguments that depend on conclusions they're supposed
    to establish. Orphaned threads — ideas introduced but never resolved
    or integrated. Redundancies — chapters that duplicate work done
    elsewhere without adding value.

    The confrontation pass is not about finding fault for its own sake
    but about identifying where a sophisticated critic would most
    effectively intervene, and where the text's structural choices
    reveal tensions between what the author wants to argue and what
    the argumentative architecture can actually support.
