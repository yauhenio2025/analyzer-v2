  label: Exhaustive Semantic Field Mapping
  description: |-
    Map every significant concept with its full relationship network.
    No significance threshold -- trace every term that does intellectual
    work, including minor variants and terms the author uses without
    defining. For each concept, build the complete semantic field with
    cross-disciplinary comparison: how does the author's usage differ
    from how the same term functions in neighboring fields? Track
    co-occurrence statistics to reveal the implicit conceptual
    architecture encoded in language habits. This pass must be
    exhaustive because subsequent passes build on it.

  label: Structural Analysis and Tension Detection
  description: |-
    Build the full structural apparatus from the semantic field data.
    Map all concept clusters with internal structure (core vs. peripheral
    members) and inter-cluster dynamics (complementary, competing,
    nested). Perform exhaustive boundary analysis: every significant
    conceptual boundary mapped with sharpness, the author's awareness,
    and strategic uses of ambiguity. Track usage patterns through the
    entire text with attention to meaning drift, contextual variation,
    and definition-usage mismatches. Adopt a confrontational stance
    toward apparent coherence: where do concepts that seem harmonious
    actually harbor tensions? Where do boundaries that seem clear
    actually conceal productive ambiguity?

  label: Dialectical Working-Through of Boundary Tensions
  description: |-
    The architecture pass revealed tensions — boundary terms where
    concepts resist clean separation, clusters that compete rather
    than complement, usage patterns that contradict definitions. Now
    inhabit these tensions dialectically rather than resolving them.

    For each significant boundary tension, perform Aufhebung: the
    boundary between two concepts (say "power" and "authority") is
    not a line to be drawn but a productive zone where both concepts
    reveal their limitations. The author's inability to draw a clean
    boundary is not a failure of precision but a discovery — the
    boundary IS fuzzy because the phenomena resist the distinction
    the author needs. Articulate what the boundary tension reveals
    about the limits of the author's conceptual vocabulary.

    Where concept clusters compete — pulling the same terms toward
    different thematic centers — do not adjudicate which cluster the
    term "really" belongs to. Instead, trace what the competition
    reveals: a concept claimed by two clusters is doing double duty,
    and that double duty is often where the argument's real work
    happens. The concept's meaning is constituted by its tension
    between the clusters, not by its allegiance to either.

    Where usage contradicts definition, resist the temptation to
    declare one "real" and the other "misleading." The gap between
    definition and usage is itself a semantic fact — it reveals that
    the concept is richer (or more conflicted) than the author's
    explicit understanding of it. Trace what the concept is trying
    to become that its definition cannot yet accommodate.

  label: Connotation Landscape and Semantic Synthesis
  description: |-
    Complete the connotation landscape: every significant term assessed
    for evaluative charge, aesthetic and emotional associations, and
    comparison with disciplinary and everyday connotations. Analyze
    how the author's connotation choices constitute an implicit rhetoric.
    Then synthesize all dimensions into the full semantic architecture,
    now enriched by the dialectical pass's working-through of boundary
    tensions. Where the dialectical pass found productive fuzziness,
    the synthesis should preserve it — not flatten it into false
    precision. Where boundary tensions revealed concepts trying to
    become something their definitions cannot yet accommodate, note
    these as sites of semantic evolution. Assess whether the argument
    would survive if connotation-loaded terms were replaced with
    neutral equivalents. Produce the integrated semantic profile that
    downstream engines will consume — one that honors the generative
    tensions rather than papering over them.
