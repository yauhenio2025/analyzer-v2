  label: Exhaustive Tactic Detection
  description: |-
    Exhaustive detection including borderline cases with explicit
    reasoning for inclusion/exclusion. Every detectable tactic
    instance mapped with comprehensive vocabulary, framing, and
    methodological evidence. Include comparison of the same tactic
    across multiple work-pairs where applicable.

  label: Pattern Analysis & Management Style
  description: |-
    With the full detection catalog, analyze patterns: distribution
    across the 10 tactic types, cluster identification showing which
    tactics reinforce each other, and characterization of the author's
    overall intellectual management style (escalator, reviser,
    narrator, amnesiac). Brief effectiveness assessment for each
    detected instance.

  label: Effectiveness, Taxonomy & Reflexive Assessment
  description: |-
    Comprehensive effectiveness analysis: each instance rated for
    execution quality, audience-relative effectiveness, and
    transparency. Full taxonomy instantiation: every category
    assessed for fit, hybrids and novel tactics documented with
    proposed classifications. Reflexive assessment of whether this
    author's practice reveals limitations in the taxonomy itself.
