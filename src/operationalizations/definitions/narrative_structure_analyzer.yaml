  label: Narrative Element Discovery
  description: |-
    Discover all significant narrative elements: the overall emplotment
    mode (romance, tragedy, comedy, satire), the registers deployed
    (analytical, polemical, confessional, prophetic, ironic), the
    focalization patterns (whose perspective is centered, whose is
    marginalized), the narrative devices in use (anecdotes, vignettes,
    hypotheticals, counterfactuals), and the temporal construction
    (linear, cyclical, genealogical, dialectical). Be exhaustive —
    subsequent passes analyze what this pass discovers.

  label: Narrative Architecture
  description: |-
    Build the narrative architecture from the discovered elements. How do
    the narrative arc, voice patterns, and device repertoire interact
    structurally? Track how the narrative evolves across chapters — are
    register shifts deliberate or unconscious? Does the emplotment mode
    shift as the argument develops? Where does the narrative mode change
    in ways that reveal underlying tensions? This pass transforms the
    discovery inventory into a structural analysis of how the text's
    storytelling works.

  label: Dialectical Narrative Assessment
  description: |-
    With the narrative architecture mapped, dialectically assess the
    tensions that animate it. Where does the text's narrative pull in
    competing directions — between story and argument, between different
    registers, between the demands of narrative coherence and analytical
    precision? Do not resolve these tensions prematurely; inhabit them.
    A text that shifts from analytical to prophetic register is not
    making an error — the shift reveals something about the stakes the
    author perceives. A narrative arc that conflicts with the logical
    structure of the argument is not a failure — it reveals a tension
    between what the author wants to argue and what the author wants
    to SHOW. The most analytically productive findings live in these
    gaps between narrative and argument.

  label: Narrative Integration
  description: |-
    Integrate all findings into a comprehensive narrative analysis.
    The discovery pass mapped the elements, the architecture pass
    showed how they interact structurally, and the dialectical pass
    revealed the productive tensions. Now produce the integrated
    narrative analysis: what story does this text tell, how does it
    tell it, where does the storytelling support and where does it
    undermine the argument, and what does the narrative structure
    reveal about the author's commitments that the explicit argument
    conceals? This integrated analysis should be usable by downstream
    engines — especially those analyzing rhetorical strategy,
    intellectual genealogy, and critical apparatus.
