  label: Exhaustive Lexical and Methodological Excavation
  description: |-
    Exhaustive inventory with no significance threshold. Every coined
    term, every repurposed term, every terminological cluster traced
    to its intellectual tradition. Full methodological fingerprint
    cross-referenced with traditions that favor these methods, including
    mismatches between stated and practiced methodology. Complete
    metaphor archaeology: maturity assessment (fresh vs. polished
    through reuse), what each metaphor reveals and conceals. Framing
    politics: what alternative framings were available but not used,
    who benefits from the chosen framing. Leave nothing for later
    passes to discover at this level.

  label: Structural Architecture and Cross-Domain Tracing
  description: |-
    Build the complete structural skeleton of the work's conceptual
    apparatus. Map every dependency between frameworks -- foundational,
    dependent, peripheral, competing, complementary, emergent. Perform
    load-bearing assessment: what collapses if each framework is
    removed? Trace every cross-domain import to its source tradition,
    assess how adaptation changed the original, and map what the source
    domain's assumptions smuggle into the current argument. The
    architecture should be detailed enough to serve as a structural
    blueprint of the author's intellectual edifice.

  label: Integrative Profile Synthesis
  description: |-
    Synthesize all dimensions into the complete target profile that
    downstream engines will consume. Cross-reference vocabulary clusters
    with architectural dependencies -- do terminological families align
    with framework hierarchies? Assess how the methodological signature
    constrains which frameworks can be deployed. Evaluate the coherence
    of the whole ensemble: does the conceptual architecture support the
    framing claims? Do domain crossings enrich or distort the framework
    architecture? Produce genealogical implications: what does this
    profile predict about the author's intellectual formation, and what
    should downstream engines (semantic constellation, inferential
    commitment mapper) look for?
