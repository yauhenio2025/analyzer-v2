  label: Rapid Relationship Classification
  description: |-
    Rapid classification based on the strongest signal. Assign one
    of the five relationship types (direct_precursor, indirect_
    contextualizer, methodological_ancestor, contradicted_position,
    parallel_development) and assess strength (strong/moderate/weak)
    with one-sentence justification for each.

  - relationship_type
  - relationship_strength

  - classify_relationship
  - assess_strength
- stance_key: inference
  label: Nuanced Classification & Strategic Guidance
  description: |-
    Nuanced classification with primary and secondary types, each
    supported by detailed evidence. Assessment of how the
    relationship may have shifted over time (temporal evolution).
    Full channel interaction analysis showing how influence channels
    reinforce or undermine each other. Detailed strategic guidance
    with contingency plans: priority dimensions ranked, expected
    trace types with specific hypotheses, and recommendations for
    revising classification if Pass 2 evidence contradicts it.
