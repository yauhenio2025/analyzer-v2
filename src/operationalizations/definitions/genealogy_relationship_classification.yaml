  label: Rapid Relationship Classification
  description: |-
    Rapid classification based on the strongest signal. Assign one
    of the five relationship types (direct_precursor, indirect_
    contextualizer, methodological_ancestor, contradicted_position,
    parallel_development) and assess strength (strong/moderate/weak)
    with one-sentence justification for each. Gather initial textual
    evidence from citations, vocabulary overlap, structural parallels,
    and conspicuous absences. At surface depth this is the only pass;
    at deeper depths it provides the broad classification that
    subsequent passes refine.

  label: Channel Mapping & Scanning Strategy
  description: |-
    With relationship type and strength established from the discovery
    pass, map the structural channels through which influence flows.
    Assess all five influence channels (vocabulary, methodology,
    audience, authority, framing) with specific evidence for each.
    Analyze how channels reinforce or undermine each other — vocabulary
    transfers carrying methodological assumptions, audience preparation
    enabling authority transfer. Distinguish channels the author
    recognizes from those operating below awareness. Translate the
    complete classification into operational scanning strategy: priority
    dimensions ranked, expected trace types with specific hypotheses,
    and recommended attention level (high/medium/low) for Pass 2
    dimensional scanners.

  label: Classification Stress-Testing & Contingency Planning
  description: |-
    Subject the relationship classifications to adversarial stress-
    testing. For each classification, ask: what would it cost if this
    is wrong? What evidence would need to emerge in Pass 2 to trigger
    reclassification? Identify the most ambiguous or hybrid
    relationships where misclassification risk is highest. For
    complex cases, assess whether the relationship has shifted over
    time — a work might have been a direct precursor early in the
    author's career that became mere background later. Produce
    contingency instructions for revising classification if Pass 2
    evidence contradicts it. Identify prior works that should be
    scanned together because their channels reinforce each other.

  label: Nuanced Classification & Strategic Guidance
  description: |-
    Nuanced classification with primary and secondary types, each
    supported by detailed evidence. Assessment of how the
    relationship may have shifted over time (temporal evolution).
    Full channel interaction analysis showing how influence channels
    reinforce or undermine each other. Detailed strategic guidance
    with contingency plans: priority dimensions ranked, expected
    trace types with specific hypotheses, and recommendations for
    revising classification if Pass 2 evidence contradicts it.
