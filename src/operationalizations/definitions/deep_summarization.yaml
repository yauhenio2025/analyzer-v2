  label: Architectural Discovery
  description: |-
    Discover the thesis architecture, chapter functions, conceptual moves,
    and vocabulary landscape. This is the foundational pass — map everything
    that subsequent passes will analyze, evaluate, and integrate. Be
    exhaustive: every significant thesis, every chapter function, every
    conceptual move, every distinctive term. Downstream passes depend on
    the completeness of this discovery.

  label: Analytical Architecture
  description: |-
    With the argument structure mapped, build the analytical architecture:
    audit evidence patterns across the argument, analyze how rhetorical
    strategies operate beyond the logical level, detect the pattern of
    foregrounding and suppression, and assess what this analysis enables
    for downstream engines. This pass transforms the discovery inventory
    into a structured analytical framework.

- stance_key: confrontation
  label: Critical Confrontation
  description: |-
    Stress-test the thesis architecture discovered in pass 1 and analyzed
    in pass 2. Where are the load-bearing walls weakest? Which evidence
    gaps are most consequential? Where does foregrounding/suppression
    conceal genuine argumentative problems rather than merely reflecting
    legitimate scope choices? Challenge the text's own self-presentation:
    does the argument actually accomplish what it claims? Are the unstated
    premises defensible? Where would a sophisticated critic most effectively
    strike? This confrontational stance produces the most analytically
    productive findings — the points where the text's surface coherence
    conceals real structural tensions.

  label: Integrative Synthesis
  description: |-
    Integrate all findings from discovery, architecture, and confrontation
    into the comprehensive deep summarization. The thesis architecture is
    now refined by confrontation — we know where it's strong and where it's
    vulnerable. Evidence patterns have been audited and stress-tested.
    Vocabulary has been mapped and its intellectual debts identified.
    Foregrounding/suppression patterns have been exposed and their
    significance assessed. Now produce the integrated output: a deep
    summarization that captures not just what the text says but what it
    DOES — its architectural logic, its rhetorical deployment, its
    conceptual operations, its blind spots, and what all of this enables
    for downstream analytical engines.
