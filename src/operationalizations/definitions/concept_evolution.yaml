  label: Concept Discovery Scan
  description: |-
    Scan for shared concepts between prior and current work. Note
    obvious vocabulary changes (births, deaths, renames) and list
    the dominant evolution types (expansion, narrowing, reversal).
    At surface depth this is a quick scan for the strongest signals.

  label: Full Koselleckian Conceptual History
  description: |-
    Complete Koselleckian conceptual history in a single intensive
    pass. Full term inventories for both works with detailed drift
    analysis and quoted evidence. Metaphor archaeology tracing
    source domains and evolution trajectories. Framing trajectory
    mapping with confidence arcs. Coupling analysis across all four
    dimensions revealing change archetypes. Concept genealogy trees
    showing ancestor-descendant relationships and co-evolution
    patterns.

  label: Structural Evolution Pattern Analysis
  description: |-
    With the vocabulary and trajectory catalog established, analyze
    the structural evolution patterns. Methodology evolution: how
    does the author's analytical toolkit change — do they import new
    methods, abandon old ones, or hybridize? Trace the evolution of
    methodological commitments across works. Metaphor evolution: map
    the source domain shifts — when an author switches from spatial
    to temporal metaphors, what conceptual restructuring does this
    signal? Framing evolution: track how the same problem is framed
    differently across works, revealing shifts in the author's
    understanding of what the problem actually is.

  label: Dimensional Comparison Matrix Synthesis
  description: |-
    Synthesize the full evolutionary landscape into the dimensional
    comparison matrix. The discovery pass mapped vocabulary changes
    and concept trajectories; the architecture pass analyzed structural
    evolution in methodology, metaphor, and framing. Now produce the
    integrated matrix: coupling analysis across all dimensions
    revealing change archetypes — does vocabulary change track
    methodology change, or do they decouple? Concept genealogy
    trees showing ancestor-descendant relationships and co-evolution
    patterns. The final portrait: is the author's conceptual evolution
    coherent (all dimensions moving together) or fragmented (vocabulary
    changing while methodology stays fixed)? What does the pattern of
    co-evolution reveal about the author's intellectual development?
