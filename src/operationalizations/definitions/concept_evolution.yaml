stance_operationalizations:
- stance_key: discovery
  label: Concept Discovery Scan
  description: |-
    Scan for shared concepts between prior and current work. Note
    obvious vocabulary changes (births, deaths, renames) and list
    the dominant evolution types (expansion, narrowing, reversal).
    At surface depth this is a quick scan for the strongest signals.

  label: Full Koselleckian Conceptual History
  description: |-
    Complete Koselleckian conceptual history in a single intensive
    pass. Full term inventories for both works with detailed drift
    analysis and quoted evidence. Metaphor archaeology tracing
    source domains and evolution trajectories. Framing trajectory
    mapping with confidence arcs. Coupling analysis across all four
    dimensions revealing change archetypes. Concept genealogy trees
    showing ancestor-descendant relationships and co-evolution
    patterns.
