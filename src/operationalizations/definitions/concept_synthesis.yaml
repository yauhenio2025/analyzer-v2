  label: Semantic Core Synthesis and Critical Verdict
  description: |-
    Produce the culminating synthesis, now enriched by the dialectical
    pass's working-through of convergence and divergence tensions.
    Establish layered semantic cores showing how meaning accreted
    over time — but where the dialectical pass found that contradictions
    drove the evolution, let the semantic core preserve the productive
    tension rather than smoothing it into false coherence. Build
    complete argumentative architecture with vulnerability analysis.
    Render detailed critical verdicts with evidence chains, field-level
    implications, and recommendations. Where the dialectical pass
    found that the author's most original contributions emerged from
    unstable, contradictory commitments rather than stable ones,
    incorporate this into the critical assessment — recognizing that
    intellectual fertility and logical consistency may be in genuine
    tension. Reflect on the methodology itself: what does this
    synthesis reveal about the limits of the genealogical method?
    What could a different analytical approach have discovered that
    this one missed?

  label: Comprehensive Timeline and Trace Reconstruction
  description: |-
    Exhaustive reconstruction of the raw conceptual history. Build
    comprehensive timelines for every traceable concept including
    proto-forms and abandoned variants. Track mutual timeline
    interactions -- how one concept's evolution influenced another's.
    Produce full aggregation with cross-concept interaction analysis.
    Deep orphan investigation: trace possible external sources for
    concepts without corpus ancestry. Assess the corpus's conceptual
    metabolism -- how quickly and thoroughly the author processes and
    transforms ideas. Leave no factual stone unturned.

  label: Convergence Stress-Testing and Enabler Archaeology
  description: |-
    Stress-test the evolution picture produced in Pass 1. Map all
    convergence and divergence points with mutual interactions.
    Challenge apparent convergences: are they genuine synthesis or
    superficial juxtaposition? Expose hidden dependencies -- arguments
    that only work because of specific, unacknowledged evolution paths.
    Perform counterfactual analysis: what would the argument look like
    if key convergences had not occurred? Conduct full toolkit
    archaeology of indirect enablers: all non-obvious influences mapped
    with interaction effects, visibility assessment, and comparison of
    acknowledged vs. actual influences. Adopt an architectural stance
    toward the structural skeleton of the evolution.

  label: Dialectical Working-Through of Convergence and Divergence
  description: |-
    The confrontation pass stress-tested convergences and exposed
    hidden dependencies. Now inhabit the deepest tensions dialectically.
    Intellectual evolution is not a smooth refinement but a process
    driven by internal contradiction — concepts evolve BECAUSE they
    are under pressure from within, not despite it.

    For each major divergence point — where ideas from different works
    pull in opposite directions — perform genuine dialectical work.
    Do not ask which direction is "correct." Ask: what does the
    divergence reveal about what the concept is trying to become?
    When an author's early and late positions on the same concept
    contradict each other, the contradiction is not a mistake to be
    explained away but a record of the concept's own dialectical
    development. The early position contained, in embryo, the seeds
    of its own negation — and the late position is the determinate
    negation that preserved what was valuable while transcending
    what was inadequate.

    For convergence points — where separately evolved ideas come
    together — ask whether the synthesis is genuine Aufhebung or
    mere juxtaposition. A genuine synthesis produces something that
    neither contributing thread could have generated alone. A mere
    juxtaposition places ideas side by side without the collision
    that generates new understanding. Most authors believe their
    convergences are genuine syntheses; dialectical scrutiny often
    reveals they are juxtapositions with synthetic aspirations.

    Trace the longest arcs of contradiction across the corpus.
    Where does the author's thought negate itself most dramatically?
    Where is that negation most productive — yielding the author's
    most original contributions? The hypothesis is that the deepest
    insights emerge not from the stable commitments but from the
    unstable ones: the ideas that the author could never quite
    reconcile, that kept generating new attempts at resolution,
    each attempt itself becoming a contribution.
