  label: Exhaustive Functional Classification
  description: |-
    Exhaustive classification of every significant conceptual chain
    with multi-layered function assessment. For each chain, determine
    primary, secondary, and tertiary functions with detailed textual
    evidence. Track diachronic function shifts: how has the chain's
    argumentative role changed over the author's career? Assess
    whether the author is aware of each chain's actual function.
    Compare stated vs. actual argumentative roles. No chain is too
    minor to classify -- peripheral chains often do unrecognized
    structural work.

  label: Complete Architectural Engineering
  description: |-
    Build the complete dependency graph of the argumentative
    architecture. Map every hierarchical relationship, bottleneck,
    and structural logic pattern (linear, branching, converging,
    cyclic). Perform comprehensive load-bearing analysis: rank all
    load-bearing chains by structural importance, assess support
    proportionality, identify single points of failure, compare
    prominence with importance. Execute full redundancy audit:
    complete overlap map with intentionality assessment for each
    redundancy, resilience analysis, and historical redundancy
    trajectory. Compare the author's explicit argument structure
    with the implicit architecture revealed by functional analysis.

  label: Adversarial Vulnerability Assessment
  description: |-
    Subject the entire argumentative architecture to adversarial
    stress-testing. Simulate how a sophisticated interlocutor would
    attack: which chains would they target, what objections would
    they raise, where would the argument break? Map all weak points
    with severity and exploitability ratings. Assess which defensive
    chains are weakest relative to the objections they face. Identify
    bridge concepts doing unacknowledged heavy lifting. Reflect on
    whether some vulnerabilities are productive (enabling flexibility
    and future development) vs. dangerous (threatening collapse under
    scrutiny). Compare vulnerability patterns across the author's
    career: are they getting better or worse at structural defense?
    Produce recommendations for structural reinforcement.

  label: Dialectical Working-Through of Structural Tensions
  description: |-
    The confrontation pass identified vulnerabilities; now inhabit
    them dialectically. The key question is not "how can these
    weaknesses be fixed?" but "what do these structural tensions
    PRODUCE?" An argument's vulnerabilities are not merely flaws
    to be patched — they are often the sites of the argument's
    greatest generative power.

    For each significant structural tension, perform Aufhebung.
    A load-bearing chain that lacks adequate support is vulnerable,
    yes — but it may be load-bearing BECAUSE it is doing genuinely
    novel work that existing argumentative resources cannot yet
    support. The vulnerability is a symptom of intellectual
    ambition outrunning available justification. Articulate what
    each vulnerable chain is reaching for that the current
    argumentative architecture cannot yet deliver.

    Where redundancy exists, ask whether the multiplied chains
    are genuinely saying the same thing or whether the apparent
    redundancy conceals a dialectical development — each
    "redundant" chain actually advancing the argument by
    approaching the same conclusion from a different angle,
    and the convergence of these different angles constituting
    a stronger form of justification than any single chain could
    provide. What looks like waste may be dialectical triangulation.

    Where single-thread dependencies create fragility, do not
    simply flag the risk. Trace WHY the author could not build
    redundancy at that point. Often, single-thread dependencies
    mark the places where the argument is most original — where
    the author had to forge a new path with no existing support
    structures to draw on. The fragility and the originality
    are two faces of the same intellectual situation. Articulate
    this relationship: where is fragility the price of ambition,
    and where is it simply carelessness?

    The overall question: does the argument's structural tension
    create a productive instability that drives intellectual
    development, or a destructive instability that threatens
    collapse? Most arguments contain both kinds. Distinguish them.
