  description: |-
    Exhaustive inventory of every significant commitment: all explicit
    claims with centrality, originality, evidential basis, and
    management style; all implicit commitments with inference strength,
    author awareness, and assessment of whether each implication is
    welcome or awkward.

  label: Full Conflict & Dependency Analysis
  description: |-
    Full conflict analysis: every significant tension mapped with
    conflict type, navigation strategy, and success assessment.
    Complete dependency graph: foundational commitments, derived
    chains, circular dependencies, single-point-of-failure analysis,
    and load-bearing assessment for each foundational commitment.

  label: Dialectical Working-Through of Commitment Conflicts
  description: |-
    Do not resolve the commitment conflicts found in Pass 2 — inhabit
    them. For each significant tension between commitments, perform
    genuine dialectical work: state the thesis (the commitment in its
    strongest form), identify its internal negation (the point where
    the commitment's own logic undermines itself), and dwell in the
    collision until a higher-order understanding emerges.

    Which commitment conflicts are PRODUCTIVE — generating insight
    precisely because they cannot be resolved? The tension between a
    commitment to individual autonomy and a commitment to social
    determination, for instance, may be the engine that drives the
    entire argument forward. Collapsing it would not fix the argument
    but destroy it. Identify these generative contradictions and
    articulate what they produce that neither side could generate alone.

    Which conflicts are genuinely DESTRUCTIVE — where the author is
    committed to incompatible positions and the incompatibility is not
    productive but simply a flaw? For these, trace what a determinate
    negation would look like: not just "this fails" but "this fails in
    a way that points toward what is actually needed." Every negation
    should contain, in embryo, the specification of what would succeed.

    Pay special attention to commitment chains where accepting premise A
    forces commitment B, which contradicts commitment C, which the
    author also needs. These cascading contradictions often reveal that
    the author's real position is not any of the stated commitments but
    an unstated position that would require restructuring the entire
    commitment landscape. Articulate what that unstated position might be.

  label: Hidden Implications & Commitment Landscape Synthesis
  description: |-
    Synthesize the full commitment landscape, now enriched by the
    dialectical pass's working-through of commitment conflicts.
    Hidden implications traced to source commitments, performative
    contradictions surfaced, citation baggage analysis revealing
    inherited commitments the author may not realize they carry,
    package deal identification with incompatibility mapping. The
    dialectical pass distinguished productive from destructive
    contradictions — integrate this into the overall commitment
    landscape synthesis. Where contradictions are productive, the
    synthesis should preserve them as generative tensions. Where
    they are destructive, the synthesis should articulate what
    restructuring of commitments the analysis points toward. The
    result is a map of what you are really signing up for — including
    which tensions come with the package and which signal genuine
    problems in the author's position.
