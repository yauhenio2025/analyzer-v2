  label: Migration Discovery
  description: |-
    Identify the most obvious concept migrations between prior and
    current work. For each migration, note the mechanism of travel
    (cited, silently borrowed, absorbed) and whether the concept
    was carried faithfully or adapted. Quick surface scan for the
    3-5 clearest cases.

  label: Full Derridean Iterability Analysis
  description: |-
    Full Derridean iterability analysis in a single intensive pass.
    Every concept migration traced with mechanism, intermediate
    stops, and contextual analysis. Every semantic mutation classified
    and motivated (strategic vs. drift). Appropriation assessed for
    legitimacy with impact on both original and new context.
    Distortions catalogued with counterfactuals. Recombinations
    mapped with novelty assessment. Acknowledgment patterns analyzed
    for strategic logic, revealing the author's characteristic
    appropriation style.

  label: Appropriation Pattern Architecture
  description: |-
    With the migration catalog established, analyze the structural
    patterns. For appropriation patterns: classify each by the
    Derridean iterability framework — faithful citation, productive
    misreading, strategic redefinition, unconscious absorption. For
    distortion maps: what was lost, what was gained, and whether the
    distortion serves the author's purposes or reveals a misunderstanding.
    For recombinations: map how borrowed concepts combine with original
    ideas to produce genuinely new intellectual formations, assessing
    the novelty and stability of each recombination.

  label: Appropriation Landscape Synthesis
  description: |-
    Synthesize the full appropriation landscape. The discovery pass
    mapped migrations and acknowledgments; the architecture pass
    analyzed structural patterns in appropriation, distortion, and
    recombination. Now produce the integrated assessment: what is
    the author's characteristic appropriation style? Are they a
    faithful transmitter, a productive transformer, or a strategic
    re-appropriator? How does the acknowledgment pattern align with
    the actual appropriation — does the author acknowledge what they
    transform but silently borrow what they preserve? Map the full
    trajectory from source through mutation to recombination,
    producing a portrait of intellectual iterability in action.
