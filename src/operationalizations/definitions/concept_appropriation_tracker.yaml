  label: Migration Discovery
  description: |-
    Identify the most obvious concept migrations between prior and
    current work. For each migration, note the mechanism of travel
    (cited, silently borrowed, absorbed) and whether the concept
    was carried faithfully or adapted. Quick surface scan for the
    3-5 clearest cases.

  label: Full Derridean Iterability Analysis
  description: |-
    Full Derridean iterability analysis in a single intensive pass.
    Every concept migration traced with mechanism, intermediate
    stops, and contextual analysis. Every semantic mutation classified
    and motivated (strategic vs. drift). Appropriation assessed for
    legitimacy with impact on both original and new context.
    Distortions catalogued with counterfactuals. Recombinations
    mapped with novelty assessment. Acknowledgment patterns analyzed
    for strategic logic, revealing the author's characteristic
    appropriation style.
