  label: Landscape of Enabling & Constraining Conditions
  description: |-
    Exhaustive mapping of what had to be true for this argument to become
    thinkable and these practices possible. For enabling conditions: every
    conceptual foundation, audience preparation, authority establishment,
    framework reuse, and methodological precedent that makes the current
    argument possible — each assessed for essentiality (critical/important/
    supporting) with textual evidence. For constraining conditions: every
    prior commitment that limits or binds, audience expectation, framework
    lock-in, reputational stake, and methodological path-dependence — each
    assessed for binding force (strong/moderate/weak). Also detect
    cross-domain transfers: intellectual toolkits imported from other fields
    that shape thinking below conscious awareness, whether acknowledged or
    invisible.

  label: Path Dependency Chains & Unacknowledged Debts
  description: |-
    With the landscape of conditions mapped, trace the structural chains.
    Path dependencies: causal chains showing how prior positions accumulate
    into current constraints and enablements — the intellectual archaeology
    of how A led to B led to C, which now serves as unexamined premise for
    D. For each chain: the sequence of works and positions involved, whether
    the chain is acknowledged or hidden, and how the argument would collapse
    if key links were removed. Unacknowledged debts: ideas presented as new
    that were actually developed in earlier work, borrowings from prior work
    without citation, inherited frameworks used without attribution — with
    hypothesized reasons for non-acknowledgment (embarrassment, oversight,
    desire for novelty, strategic concealment). Alternative paths: at key
    branching points, what could the author have argued instead from the same
    starting conditions, and what intellectual, institutional, or audience
    resources favored the path actually taken.

  label: Counterfactual Stress-Testing
  description: |-
    The central thought experiment: imagine this argument written by someone
    with no prior work history. What changes? What remains? This separates
    genuine innovation from accumulated intellectual capital. For each major
    claim or position, assess: is this genuinely new (would exist without
    any prior work), or is it path-dependent inheritance (could only emerge
    from this specific history)? Estimate the proportion of intellectual
    capital that is novel versus inherited. Assess whether path-dependence
    adds depth (accumulated expertise enriching the argument) or creates a
    trap (inherited assumptions preventing growth). Revisit the alternative
    paths from the architecture pass: for the most significant branching
    points, construct detailed counterfactual scenarios — what the argument
    would look like if a different path had been taken, what would be gained
    and lost.

  label: Synthetic Judgment & Conditions Landscape
  description: |-
    Synthesize the full conditions landscape. The discovery pass mapped
    enabling and constraining conditions; the architecture pass traced the
    structural chains and debts; the confrontation pass stress-tested via
    counterfactual. Now produce the synthetic judgment: on balance, is the
    intellectual biography more enabling or constraining? Does the author
    manage their intellectual history productively — deploying prior work
    strategically while remaining open to revision — or are they trapped by
    accumulated commitments? Is their awareness of path-dependence itself
    productive (enabling reflexive scholarship) or performative (acknowledged
    but not acted upon)? Integrate the enabling and constraining conditions
    into a unified landscape showing how they interact, where cross-domain
    transfers create unique capabilities, and where the counterfactual
    analysis reveals the argument's deepest dependencies. The result should
    be a map of what had to be true for this argument to exist, what it
    costs the author to maintain it, and what alternatives remain available.
