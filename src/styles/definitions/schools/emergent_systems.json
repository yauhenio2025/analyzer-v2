  "philosophy": "Complex systems deserve complex visualizations that reveal their structure. Interactivity as a core principle—even static work hints at exploration affordances. Scientific rigor meets aesthetic ambition. Large-scale pattern revelation is the goal: seeing structure emerge from apparent chaos. Network thinking applied to cultural, social, and scientific data. The 'Aha!' moment when hidden relationships become visible. Technical sophistication should be evident in the result. Visualization as scientific instrument, not mere decoration.",
