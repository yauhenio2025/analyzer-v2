  "philosophy": "Data Humanism as articulated by Giorgia Lupi: Data represents REAL people and phenomena. Imperfection and hand-crafted feel is valuable. Complex is not complicated - embrace richness. Personal and emotional dimensions of data. Each data point has a story. Visual complexity that rewards exploration. Beauty as a form of respect for the data. Context and narrative as primary. The 'Dear Data' principle: data as intimate diary.",

    "Layering for depth and discovery",
    "Key/legend as beautiful design element",
    "Small details reward close reading",
    "Title as almost calligraphic element",
    "Works as art piece on the wall"
  ],
  "annotation_style": "Narrative and personal. Write as if telling a story. Annotations can be longer, more contemplative. Hand-lettered aesthetic even if typeset. Legend as a beautiful decoded key, placed thoughtfully. Encourage exploration: 'if you look closely...' Connect data to human experience in annotations. Poetic register is acceptable.",
  "gemini_modifiers": "STYLE INSTRUCTIONS (Giorgia Lupi / Data Humanism):\n- Create a visualization that feels HUMAN and CRAFTED\n- Warm, organic color palette: cream background (#faf7f2), deep reds, forest greens, gold accents\n- Hand-drawn aesthetic - not rigid or mechanical\n- Organic, flowing layouts - radial, circular, or freeform\n- Each element can have unique character\n- Typography: elegant serifs (Garamond, Didot style)\n- Think of this as DATA ART - beautiful enough to hang on a wall\n- Legend/key as a beautiful design element, not just utilitarian\n- Embrace complexity - layers reward exploration\n- Annotations can be narrative, even poetic\n- Small details for those who look closely\n- NO stark, corporate, or mechanical feel\n- Warm and inviting, not cold and clinical",
