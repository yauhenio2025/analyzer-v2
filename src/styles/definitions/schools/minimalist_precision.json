  "philosophy": "Maximize the data-ink ratio: every visual element should convey information. Eliminate chartjunk—no decorative grids, unnecessary frames, or ornament. Use small multiples to enable comparison across dimensions. Sparklines embed word-sized graphics in running text. Show the data, minimize imposed interpretation. Micro/macro readings work at glance AND on close inspection. Graphical integrity means no lie factors, no misleading perspectives. The goal is clear, honest, dense communication.",
