  "philosophy": "Maximize the data-ink ratio: every visual element should convey information. Eliminate chartjunk—no decorative grids, unnecessary frames, or ornament. Use small multiples to enable comparison across dimensions. Sparklines embed word-sized graphics in running text. Show the data, minimize imposed interpretation. Micro/macro readings work at glance AND on close inspection. Graphical integrity means no lie factors, no misleading perspectives. The goal is clear, honest, dense communication.",

  "gemini_modifiers": "STYLE INSTRUCTIONS (Minimalist Precision Graphics):\n- Use MAXIMUM data-ink ratio: every pixel should convey information\n- NO chartjunk: no decorative grids, 3D effects, shadows, or gradients\n- Color palette: near-black (#1a1a1a) for data, white background, minimal gray for structure\n- Remove all unnecessary borders, boxes, and frames\n- Direct label data points instead of using legends\n- Axis lines minimal or absent if scale is clear from data\n- Use small multiples if showing comparisons\n- Typography: Georgia or classic serif, normal weight, no bold titles\n- White space as separator, not lines\n- Precision over decoration\n- If uncertain, remove rather than add",
