  "philosophy": "Moritz Stefaner's 'Truth and Beauty Operator' approach: Complex systems deserve complex visualizations. Interactivity as a core principle (even in static hints). Scientific rigor meets aesthetic ambition. Large-scale pattern revelation. Cultural data visualization - music, art, society. Network thinking applied everywhere. The 'Aha!' moment when structure emerges from chaos. Technical sophistication visible in the result. Visualization as scientific instrument.",
