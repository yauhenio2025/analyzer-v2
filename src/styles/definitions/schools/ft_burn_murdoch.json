  "philosophy": "Financial Times graphics tradition, exemplified by John Burn-Murdoch: Extreme restraint - let the data command attention. The famous FT salmon pink as signature. Line charts as primary vehicle for showing change. Multiple series compared with clear differentiation. Annotations minimal but precisely placed. Professional gravitas appropriate for financial audiences. The chart should work in print at 2 columns wide. Emphasis through prominence, not decoration.",

  "annotation_style": "Minimal, surgical. Annotations only at critical inflection points. Short phrases, not sentences. Data point labeled directly. Use thin rules to connect annotation to data.
