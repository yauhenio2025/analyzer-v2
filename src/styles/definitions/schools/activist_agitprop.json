  "philosophy": "Inspired by Soviet constructivism, protest graphics, and movement media: PROVOKE - Design to evoke emotional response and urgency. CONTRAST - Stark visual opposition between heroes and villains. BOLD - High-contrast, attention-grabbing compositions. CLEAR - One unmistakable message per visualization. ACTION - Every graphic implies 'what you should do'. SHAREABLE - Optimized for social media impact and virality. RIGHTEOUS - Frame the issue as moral imperative, not neutral analysis.",

  "annotation_style": "Bold callouts, accusatory arrows, stark labels. Frame villains with red, heroes with white/gold. Short, punchy phrases. Imperative mood: 'Stop this' 'Act now' 'Share this'. Statistics as shocking numbers in large type. Attribution to authority figures ('Experts say...'). No nuance - clarity over complexity.",
  "gemini_modifiers": "STYLE INSTRUCTIONS (Activist / Agitprop / Mobilization Graphics):\n\nTONE:\n- This is NOT neutral analysis - take a clear moral position\n- Frame as INJUSTICE that demands response\n- Use power/victim dynamics explicitly\n- Imply urgency: 'This is happening NOW'\n\nVISUAL APPROACH:\n- HIGH CONTRAST: Red/Black/White dominant palette\n- BOLD typography: Impact font, all caps for key messages\n- ONE CLEAR MESSAGE per visual\n- Stark visual metaphors: chains, scales, targets, crosshairs, clocks\n- Villains in red/dark, victims/heroes in white/gold\n- Dramatic lighting effects\n- Fill the frame - no empty space\n\nCOMPOSITION:\n- Social media optimized (square or 4:5 ratio)\n- Works at thumbnail size\n- Central focal point\n- Call to action visible",
