  "philosophy": "The New York Times graphics desk tradition, refined by Amanda Cox: Graphics that EXPLAIN, not just display. Reader's eye is guided through a story. Annotations as teaching moments. Accessibility for general audiences while respecting intelligence. Interactive principles even in static form. The 'aha moment' - visualization reveals insight. Clarity is kindness to the reader. Every chart answers a question.",

  "annotation_style": "Generous and explanatory. Use callout boxes with subtle backgrounds. Annotations should TEACH the reader something - not just label. 'What does this mean?' answered at key inflection points. Use arrows or thin lines to connect annotations to data. Write in complete sentences when explaining significance. Header + body pattern for major annotations. Keep tone conversational but authoritative.",
  "gemini_modifiers": "STYLE INSTRUCTIONS (NYT / Amanda Cox / Explanatory Graphics):\n- Create an EXPLANATORY visualization that teaches the reader\n- Include a clear HEADLINE that states the key finding\n- Use ANNOTATIONS to guide the reader's eye through important points\n- Color palette: #333333 for data, #d63232 for emphasis, warm #f7f7f5 background\n- Typography: Sans-serif (Franklin Gothic style) for labels, serif for titles\n- Add callout boxes with pale backgrounds to highlight crucial insights\n- Write annotations as teaching moments, not just labels\n- Include clear axis labels with units\n- Source attribution visible at bottom\n- Visual hierarchy guides: what to read first, second, third\n- Think about what question this chart answers\n- Generous white space between elements",
