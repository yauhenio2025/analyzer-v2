  "philosophy": "Data represents REAL people and phenomena—never lose sight of the human stories within. Imperfection and hand-crafted feel communicate authenticity and care. Complex is not complicated: embrace visual richness that rewards patient exploration. Surface personal and emotional dimensions of data. Each data point has a story worth honoring. Visual complexity that reveals itself through exploration. Beauty as a form of respect for the data and its subjects. Context and narrative as primary concerns. Data as intimate diary rather than clinical record.",
