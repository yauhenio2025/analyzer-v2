  "description": "Traces how an author's own prior works serve as conditions of possibility for their current arguments. Uses composed chains of capability engines to profile the target work, scan prior works with relationship-aware strategies, and synthesize findings through multi-stage analysis (cross-work synthesis, functional analysis, evolution tactics, conditions of possibility). Classifies each prior work's relationship type and adapts analysis accordingly. Each engine operates through analytical stances (discovery, inference, confrontation, architecture, integration, reflection, dialectical) at configurable depth levels (surface/standard/deep).",

  "planner_strategy": "## Decision Guidelines\n\n### Depth Selection\n- Use **deep** for phases where the thinker's intellectual profile demands it:\n  - Deep target profiling when the author has complex conceptual vocabulary\n  - Deep evolution tactics detection when the author is known for reframing/appropriating ideas\n  - Deep conditions analysis when the author's intellectual context is rich\n- Use **standard** for most phases — it's the sweet spot of quality vs. cost\n- Use **surface** only for triage or when the corpus is small/simple\n\n### Engine Focus\n- Not all dimensions need equal attention for every thinker\n- For a Marxist economist like Varoufakis, prioritize: vocabulary_evolution, methodology_evolution, framing_evolution\n- For a philosopher like Benanav, prioritize: conceptual_framework, inferential_commitments, metaphor_evolution\n- For a historian like Slobodian, prioritize: conditions_of_possibility, intellectual context, path dependencies\n\n### View Recommendations\nThe VIEWS section of the catalog includes per-view planner guidance with `Planner guidance:` annotations. Follow those hints when selecting views. General rules:\n- Only recommend views with `planner_eligible: true` (views marked [NOT ELIGIBLE] are debug/utility views)\n- Prioritize views with [HAS_TEMPLATE] — these produce structured data for rich rendering\n- Views with `visibility: on_demand` should NOT be primary recommendations\n- Child views (those with a `Parent:` field) are auto-included when their parent is recommended — no need to recommend them separately\n- Read each view's planner guidance carefully and match it to the thinker's profile\n\n### Phase Skipping\n- You CAN recommend skipping phases, but this should be rare\n- Only skip if the corpus clearly doesn't warrant it (e.g., single prior work → simplified scanning)\n\n### Expanded Target Analysis (Phase 1.0) — Supplementary Chains\nPhase 1.0 runs a core 4-engine chain (genealogy_target_profiling). You can ALSO select 1-3 supplementary chains from the catalog to run AFTER the core chain. Their outputs concatenate with the core analysis, creating a richer distilled target profile.\n\n**When to add supplementary chains**:\n- Thinker has a rich argumentative style → add `argument_analysis_chain` (argument_architecture + rhetorical_strategy)\n- Thinker has complex rhetorical patterns → add `rhetorical_analysis_chain`\n- Thinker draws from specific intellectual traditions → add `conceptual_deep_dive_chain`\n- Thinker is known for anomalous claims → add `anomaly_evidence_chain`\n- When in doubt, add 1-2 supplementary chains. The cost is moderate but the downstream benefit is significant.\n\n**When you add supplementary chains**, also set `max_context_chars_override: 150000` on Phase 1.0 so the expanded analysis passes through to downstream phases without being truncated at the default 50K limit.\n\n**Supplementary chains field**: `\"supplementary_chains\": [\"argument_analysis_chain\", \"rhetorical_analysis_chain\"]`\n\n### Document Strategy for Per-Work Phases (1.5, 2.0)\nPer-work phases (1.5 Relationship Classification, 2.0 Prior Work Scanning) now receive the DISTILLED target analysis from Phase 1.0 instead of the raw target text. This means:\n- `requires_full_documents` on Phases 1.5 and 2.0 should be `false` (the distilled analysis is ~100-150K chars, not 500K+)\n- Phase 1.0 should have `requires_full_documents: true` (it processes the raw target text)\n- The per-work phases depend on Phase 1.0 completing first (1.5 now has `depends_on_phases: [1.0]`)\n- Each per-work call sees: ~37K distilled analysis + ~200K prior work text = ~237K total (vs. ~370K before)"
