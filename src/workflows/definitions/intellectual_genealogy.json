  "description": "Traces how an author's own prior works serve as conditions of possibility for their current arguments. Uses composed chains of enhanced engines to profile the target work, scan prior works with relationship-aware strategies, and synthesize findings through multi-stage analysis (cross-work synthesis, functional analysis, evolution tactics, conditions of possibility). Classifies each prior work's relationship type and adapts analysis accordingly. Operates in comprehensive mode (extract all ideas, trace all) or targeted mode (probe specific ideas).",
