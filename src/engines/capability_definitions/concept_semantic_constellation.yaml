  A concept is never an island. Every significant term exists within
  a semantic field -- a constellation of related terms, near-synonyms,
  antonyms, boundary cases, and usage patterns that together constitute
  its meaning. To understand what an author means by "power" you must
  also understand what they mean by "authority", "influence", "force",
  "domination", "hegemony" -- and crucially, where they draw the
  boundaries between these terms. The semantic constellation IS the
  meaning; the isolated definition is a shadow of it.

  This engine maps those constellations. For each significant concept
  in a work, it asks: What is the full semantic field? What terms
  cluster together, and what keeps them distinct? Where are the
  boundaries fuzzy, and where are they sharp? How does the author's
  usage pattern differ from standard usage in their field? What
  connotations attach to terms that do silent argumentative work?

  For genealogical analysis, semantic constellations are diagnostic.
  An author's semantic field for a concept reveals their intellectual
  formation more reliably than their explicit definitions. When an
  economist uses "efficiency" surrounded by terms like "allocation",
  "equilibrium", and "optimality", that is a different concept from
  a political theorist's "efficiency" surrounded by "governance",
  "legitimacy", and "accountability" -- even if both authors would
  offer similar dictionary definitions. The constellation tells you
  where the concept LIVES in the author's thinking.

  As the SECOND engine in the target profiling chain, this engine
  takes the vocabulary extracted by conceptual_framework_extraction
  and deepens it: from a list of significant terms to a map of
  semantic relationships between them. It transforms a flat vocabulary
  inventory into a structured semantic landscape that reveals how
  concepts relate, cluster, and define each other through their
  differences. This landscape then feeds the inferential commitment
  mapper, which asks what logical commitments these semantic
  relationships encode.
researcher_question: What is the full semantic field of this concept?
intellectual_lineage:
  primary:
    name: saussure
    description: 'Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913), Swiss linguist whose Course in General Linguistics
      established the foundational principle that meaning is determined not by reference to things but
      by differential relationships within a system of signs. His concept of the ''semantic field'' (champ
      sémantique) is fundamental to this engine: a term derives its meaning from its position within a
      network of related terms, from what it is NOT as much as what it IS. For mapping conceptual constellations,
      Saussure provides the core insight that to understand any concept requires mapping its relationships
      of similarity, opposition, and distinction within the author''s total semantic system.'
  secondary:
  - name: wittgenstein
    description: 'Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), Austrian-British philosopher whose later work (particularly
      Philosophical Investigations) challenged essentialist definitions by showing how meaning emerges
      from patterns of use within specific contexts or ''language games''. His concept of ''family resemblance''
      is crucial for this engine''s approach to semantic boundaries: concepts often lack defining features
      shared by all instances, instead exhibiting overlapping similarities that create fuzzy boundaries.
      This insight prevents the engine from seeking artificial precision in semantic constellations and
      instead maps the actual patterns of conceptual overlap and gradation in an author''s usage.'
  - name: lakoff
    description: George Lakoff (1941-), American cognitive linguist who demonstrated through conceptual
      metaphor theory that abstract concepts are systematically structured by metaphorical mappings from
      embodied experience. His work reveals that semantic constellations are not arbitrary but often organized
      around underlying metaphorical schemas (TIME IS SPACE, IDEAS ARE OBJECTS, etc.). For this engine,
      Lakoff provides tools for identifying the implicit conceptual metaphors that structure an author's
      semantic field—the hidden architecture that determines which terms naturally cluster together and
      which conceptual moves seem natural versus strained.
  - name: rosch
    description: Eleanor Rosch (1938-), American psychologist whose prototype theory revolutionized understanding
      of categorization by demonstrating that concepts are organized around 'best examples' rather than
      necessary-and-sufficient features, with category membership being graded rather than binary. Her
      empirical work on basic-level categories and prototype effects provides this engine with a model
      for understanding how semantic constellations have centers and peripheries—some terms are prototypical
      exemplars of a concept while others are marginal cases. This allows the engine to map not just which
      terms relate to a concept, but their distance from the conceptual core in an author's usage.
  traditions:
  - name: structural_linguistics
    description: The intellectual tradition inaugurated by Saussure that treats language as a system of
      interdependent elements where each unit is defined by its relationships to other units rather than
      by external reference. Its core methodological commitment—that linguistic analysis must identify
      the paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations that constitute the system—directly informs this engine's
      approach to mapping semantic fields. The engine adopts structural linguistics' fundamental insight
      that understanding a concept requires reconstructing the oppositional and associative networks that
      give it differential value within an author's conceptual system.
  - name: ordinary_language_philosophy
    description: The mid-20th-century philosophical movement, exemplified by the later Wittgenstein and
      J.L. Austin, that rejected abstract logical analysis in favor of examining how terms actually function
      in concrete linguistic practices. Its methodological principle—that meaning is use, revealed through
      attention to the variety of contexts and purposes for which language is deployed—guides this engine's
      emphasis on usage patterns over dictionary definitions. The tradition teaches the engine to treat
      semantic constellations as maps of actual deployment rather than formal logical relationships, attending
      to the pragmatic work concepts perform in argumentation.
  - name: cognitive_linguistics
    description: 'The interdisciplinary approach emerging in the 1970s-80s that treats language as inseparable
      from general cognitive capacities, emphasizing embodied experience, conceptual metaphor, and prototype-based
      categorization rather than formal compositional semantics. Its core commitment—that semantic structure
      reflects conceptual structure grounded in bodily and cultural experience—enables this engine to
      recognize that semantic constellations are not arbitrary but motivated by underlying cognitive schemas.
      This tradition provides the theoretical warrant for treating an author''s semantic field as diagnostic
      of their conceptual formation: the clustering patterns reveal deep cognitive commitments, not just
      stylistic choices.'
  - name: prototype_theory
    description: The theory of categorization, developed by Rosch and extended by Lakoff and others, proposing
      that categories are organized around prototypical exemplars with graded membership rather than classical
      necessary-and-sufficient definitions. Its empirical demonstration that category boundaries are often
      fuzzy and that some members are 'better examples' than others provides this engine with a non-essentialist
      model for semantic boundaries. The engine uses prototype theory to map the internal structure of
      semantic constellations—identifying which terms function as prototypes in an author's usage, which
      are peripheral, and where boundaries blur into neighboring concepts.
  - name: frame_semantics
    description: The approach developed by Charles Fillmore treating word meanings as evoking structured
      knowledge configurations (frames) that include participants, props, and relationships characteristic
      of schematized experiences. Its core analytical move—that understanding a term requires identifying
      the entire structured scenario it presupposes—extends this engine's reach beyond simple word associations
      to the conceptual frames that organize semantic fields. Frame semantics enables the engine to recognize
      that when an author uses 'buyer' and 'seller', they invoke an entire COMMERCIAL_TRANSACTION frame,
      and the constellation must map this whole structured knowledge complex, not just pairwise term relations.
  key_concepts:
  - name: semantic_field
    definition: 'The structured set of lexical items that partition a conceptual domain, each term gaining
      meaning through its differential relationships (oppositions, gradations, hyponymic relations) to
      others in the set. For this engine, the semantic field IS the primary object of analysis: mapping
      which terms an author treats as inhabiting the same conceptual territory and how they carve up that
      territory reveals the structure of their thought more reliably than analyzing terms in isolation.'
  - name: langue_parole
    definition: 'Saussure''s distinction between langue (the abstract system of language as a structured
      whole shared by a community) and parole (actual instances of language use by individuals). This
      engine operates at an intermediate level: it analyzes an individual author''s semantic system (their
      parole) but treats it as revealing an underlying structured langue—the conceptual system that generates
      their particular usage patterns, which may diverge from disciplinary norms or evolve across their
      corpus.'
  - name: language_game
    definition: 'Wittgenstein''s term for the interwoven patterns of language use and practical activity
      within which words acquire meaning—the ''game'' being the rule-governed but not rigidly determined
      practice of deploying terms for specific purposes. The engine uses this concept to contextualize
      semantic constellations: the same term may participate in different constellations depending on
      the language game (theoretical explanation, political persuasion, technical description) in which
      the author is engaged, requiring the engine to track usage patterns across argumentative contexts.'
  - name: family_resemblance
    definition: 'Wittgenstein''s model of conceptual structure where category members are related by overlapping
      similarities without any single feature common to all, like family members who share various features
      (nose, eyes, build) without any feature universal to the family. This concept guides the engine''s
      approach to semantic boundaries: rather than seeking sharp definitional boundaries between concepts,
      it maps overlapping zones where terms share some features with multiple neighboring concepts, creating
      a network of partial similarities that constitutes the semantic landscape.'
  - name: conceptual_metaphor
    definition: Lakoff's notion that abstract conceptual domains are systematically structured by mappings
      from more concrete, embodied source domains (e.g., ARGUMENT IS WAR, THEORIES ARE BUILDINGS), with
      the metaphor licensing specific inferences and entailments. The engine uses this to identify the
      underlying metaphorical architecture organizing semantic constellations—when an author's terms for
      'theory' cluster with 'foundation', 'construction', 'framework', and 'edifice', this reveals a BUILDINGS
      metaphor structuring their conceptual field, determining which theoretical moves will seem natural
      or problematic.
  - name: prototype
    definition: 'The most representative or ''best example'' of a category, around which the category
      is cognitively organized, with other members judged by their similarity to the prototype rather
      than by meeting definitional criteria. The engine uses prototype identification to map the center-periphery
      structure of semantic constellations: determining which term functions as the prototypical case
      reveals the conceptual core around which an author organizes related concepts, with other terms
      positioned at varying distances as more or less central to the constellation.'
  - name: semantic_boundary
    definition: 'The line (often fuzzy or contested) where one concept''s semantic field ends and another''s
      begins—the point at which the engine must determine whether an author treats two terms as distinct
      concepts or as variants within a single conceptual space. Mapping these boundaries is crucial for
      genealogical analysis: where an author draws sharp boundaries versus allowing overlap reveals their
      conceptual commitments, and divergences from disciplinary norms in boundary-drawing are diagnostic
      of distinct intellectual formation or theoretical innovation.'
  - name: collocation
    definition: 'The habitual co-occurrence of words in proximity—the statistical tendency for certain
      terms to appear near each other in actual usage. For this engine, collocation patterns provide empirical
      evidence for semantic constellation structure: terms that regularly appear together in an author''s
      text likely occupy related positions in their conceptual field, and the specific collocational profile
      of a term (what it habitually appears with) reveals which semantic neighbors are most salient in
      that author''s usage, potentially diverging from standard disciplinary patterns.'

- key: concept_clusters
  description: |
    Groups of concepts that form coherent sub-fields within the work -- terms that travel together, reinforce each other, and constitute a recognizable thematic unit. Clusters reveal the major conceptual building blocks of the work's argument.
  probing_questions:
  - Which concepts cluster together -- appearing in the same contexts, reinforcing the same arguments?
  - What holds each cluster together -- a shared theme, a common origin, a structural role?
  - Are clusters aligned with the work's explicit framework divisions, or do they cut across frameworks?
  - Do any concepts bridge multiple clusters, serving as connective tissue?
  - Are there isolated concepts that belong to no cluster -- orphans that might signal unfinished thinking?

- key: boundary_terms
  description: |
    The contested, fuzzy, or strategically ambiguous boundaries between concepts. Where does "power" end and "authority" begin? Boundary terms are where the most interesting intellectual work happens -- they reveal what the author is trying to distinguish and what they are content to conflate.
  probing_questions:
  - Where are the boundaries between related concepts sharp and explicit?
  - Where are boundaries fuzzy or contested -- and does the author acknowledge the fuzziness?
  - Are any boundary ambiguities strategically useful -- allowing the author to shift between meanings?
  - What would change in the argument if certain boundaries were drawn differently?
  - Do boundary terms carry different connotations that do silent argumentative work?
  depth_guidance:

      the author''s awareness of boundary issues, strategic uses of ambiguity, comparison with how other

      boundaries were drawn differently'
- key: usage_patterns
  description: |
    How concepts are actually deployed in argumentation -- not their definitions but their behavior. A concept might be defined one way but used another. Tracking usage patterns reveals the real meaning, which is often richer and more specific than the stated definition.
  probing_questions:
  - Is the concept's actual usage consistent with its stated definition?
  - Does the concept's meaning shift across different parts of the work?
  - In what argumentative contexts does the concept do the most work?
  - Are there contexts where the concept is conspicuously absent -- where you would expect it but the
    author avoids it?
  - Does the concept function differently in positive arguments vs. critiques of others?
  depth_guidance:

      to meaning drift, contextual variation, definition-usage mismatches, strategic deployment (when

      is used by other authors in the field'
- key: connotation_map
  description: |
    The evaluative and associative dimensions of concepts that operate below explicit argumentation. A term like "bureaucracy" might be technically neutral but carry negative connotations that do argumentative work without justification. Connotation mapping reveals the silent rhetoric embedded in vocabulary choices.
  probing_questions:
  - What evaluative connotations attach to key terms -- positive, negative, neutral?
  - Are connotations consistent with the author's stated analytical stance, or do they smuggle in judgments?
  - Do connotations differ from standard disciplinary usage -- has the author loaded the terms?
  - Are there pairs of terms that differ primarily in connotation rather than denotation (e.g., 'freedom
    fighter' vs. 'terrorist')?
  - What emotional or aesthetic associations do key terms carry, and how do these shape the reader's response?
  depth_guidance:

  produces_dimensions:
  - semantic_field
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability executes the foundational Saussurean insight that meaning is differential and relational rather than referential. It constructs the complete network of meaning-relations for each significant concept by identifying not what a term points to in the world, but what other terms it is defined against, clustered with, and distinguished from. For every concept like 'power,' it asks: what does the author treat as a near-synonym (influence, force, domination)? What stands in contrast (weakness, submission, anarchy)? What broader category does it belong to (social relations, political phenomena)? What specific forms does it take (coercive power, discursive power, economic power)? And crucially, what terms habitually appear in its vicinity, creating a semantic atmosphere that shapes its meaning? This is the work of recovering the langue—the system of differences—that makes any particular parole meaningful.

    Without this capability, downstream engines operate on isolated definitions rather than living meanings. The concept_cluster identification needs these relationship networks to understand what holds clusters together. The boundary analysis needs them to know where concepts meet and potentially blur. The usage tracking needs them as a baseline to detect when actual deployment deviates from systemic position. The connotation mapping needs them to distinguish between semantic relations (which are structural) and affective associations (which are rhetorical). This capability transforms a vocabulary list into a semantic topology—a landscape where proximity, distance, opposition, and hierarchy give each concept its position and therefore its meaning.

    The non-trivial challenge is distinguishing the author's semantic field from both standard disciplinary usage and the analyst's own conceptual habits. A naive approach simply lists dictionary synonyms or thesaurus entries. A sophisticated approach reconstructs how THIS author, in THIS text, organizes semantic space—which may involve idiosyncratic distinctions ('power' vs. 'force'), strategic conflations (using 'efficiency' and 'rationality' interchangeably when others distinguish them), or disciplinary boundary-crossing (borrowing 'field' from physics for sociology). The analyst must bracket their own semantic intuitions and attend forensically to the text's actual relationship patterns.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: saussure
    concept: value_through_difference
    method: Saussure's principle that linguistic signs have no positive terms, only differences, directly
      informs this capability. Meaning emerges from a term's position in a system of oppositions and associations,
      not from reference to objects. This capability operationalizes that insight by mapping the differential
      system within which each concept gains its value.
  indicators:
  - Author uses multiple terms for seemingly the same phenomenon without explicitly differentiating them
    (e.g., 'legitimacy,' 'authority,' 'rightful power')
  - Author defines concepts negatively through contrasts ('X is not mere Y') more than through positive
    characterization
  - Concepts appear consistently in the same argumentative neighborhoods, suggesting systematic co-occurrence
    patterns
  - Author's usage of a standard term seems subtly different from disciplinary norm, but the difference
    is not explicitly marked
  - Text contains explicit discussion of why certain terms are preferred over apparent synonyms
  depth_scaling:
    surface: For 3-5 core concepts, list synonyms, antonyms, broader/narrower terms, and most frequent
      collocations with relationship labels.
    standard: For all significant concepts, map full semantic networks with relationship types, document
      key distinctions the author draws between near-synonyms, provide co-occurrence statistics, and compare
      with standard disciplinary semantic fields.
    deep: Exhaustive relationship mapping for every significant concept with statistical co-occurrence
      data, genealogical tracing of where the author's semantic distinctions originate intellectually,
      systematic comparison with disciplinary and everyday usage revealing the author's semantic innovations,
      and analysis of how semantic field evolution across the work signals conceptual development.

  description: Discover groups of concepts that form coherent thematic units, with bridge concepts and
    orphans
  produces_dimensions:
  - concept_clusters
  requires_dimensions:
  - semantic_field
  extended_description: |-
    This capability discovers the natural joints in a work's conceptual architecture by identifying groups of concepts that form coherent thematic units—terms that travel together, mutually reinforce each other's meanings, and constitute recognizable intellectual gestalts. Drawing on Rosch's prototype theory, it recognizes that semantic organization is not flat but structured around cores and peripheries: some concepts are central exemplars of a cluster (the prototype) while others are marginal members. A cluster around 'rationality' might include 'calculation,' 'optimization,' and 'means-ends reasoning' as core members, with 'deliberation' and 'judgment' as more peripheral participants that bridge to other clusters. These clusters often correspond to theoretical traditions, disciplinary formations, or conceptual schemes the author has inherited or synthesized.

    This capability transforms the flat semantic field maps into a three-dimensional landscape with peaks, valleys, and ridges. It reveals the major conceptual building blocks—the 3-5 large thematic units that organize the work's thinking—and identifies bridge concepts that connect otherwise separate clusters (revealing synthetic ambitions) and orphan concepts that belong to no cluster (revealing incomplete integration or nascent thinking). For downstream engines, these clusters provide the semantic architecture against which inferential commitments and argumentative patterns will be analyzed. The boundary analysis needs clusters to know which boundaries matter most (those between major clusters). The usage tracking needs them to detect when a concept is being pulled between different cluster orbits, shifting its meaning.

    The sophistication lies in recognizing that clusters are not simply topics or subjects. A naive approach groups concepts by explicit thematic labels ('economic concepts,' 'political concepts'). A sophisticated approach identifies clusters by actual semantic behavior—which concepts genuinely co-vary in usage, share collocations, and reinforce each other's meanings, regardless of how the author explicitly organizes chapters or sections. Sometimes the most important clusters cut across the work's explicit structure, revealing a deeper conceptual architecture that the surface organization obscures.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: rosch
    concept: prototype_structure
    method: Rosch's research on category structure—showing that conceptual organization is not definitional
      but organized around prototypical exemplars with graded membership—informs this capability's recognition
      that concept clusters have cores and peripheries. The capability identifies which concepts are prototypical
      centers of semantic fields and which are marginal members, revealing the actual structure of conceptual
      organization.
  indicators:
  - Sets of 3-5 terms that repeatedly appear together in the same paragraphs or argumentative moves
  - Concepts that are routinely explained through reference to each other, forming a self-reinforcing
    semantic circle
  - Terms that share distinctive collocations or grammatical patterns, suggesting they occupy similar
    functional roles
  - Explicit discussion of theoretical traditions or intellectual schools, each with its characteristic
    vocabulary
  - Isolated technical terms that appear rarely and without integration into any recurring conceptual
    neighborhood
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Identify 2-3 major concept clusters with core members (5-8 terms each) and a label for the
      unifying theme.
    standard: Map all significant clusters with core vs. peripheral members, bridge concepts connecting
      clusters, orphan concepts, and assessment of whether clusters align with explicit organizational
      structure.
    deep: Complete cluster topology with internal structure (prototype members, graded membership strength),
      inter-cluster relationships (complementary, competing, hierarchically nested, synthesized), bridge
      concepts analyzed for their synthetic function, and assessment of whether orphans represent nascent
      clusters, borrowed terms not fully integrated, or genuine conceptual anomalies.
- key: analyze_boundaries
  description: Map the contested, fuzzy, and strategically ambiguous boundaries between related concepts
  produces_dimensions:
  - boundary_terms
  requires_dimensions:
  - semantic_field
  extended_description: |-
    This capability investigates the edges where concepts meet—the contested, fuzzy, or strategically ambiguous zones that reveal what intellectual work the author is attempting. Wittgenstein's attention to how concepts have blurred edges rather than sharp definitions, and how this fuzziness is often essential to their functioning, grounds this analysis. When an author uses both 'power' and 'influence,' where exactly does one end and the other begin? Is the boundary sharp and explicitly theorized, or is it left deliberately vague? Does the author sometimes slide between the terms as if they were interchangeable, and other times insist on their difference? These boundary behaviors are not defects to be corrected but phenomena to be documented, because they reveal what distinctions matter to the author's argument and what conflations it depends upon.

    Boundary analysis is where semantic field mapping becomes diagnostic of argumentative strategy. Many texts derive their analytical leverage precisely from how they draw boundaries differently than predecessors. A theorist who sharply distinguishes 'power' from 'authority' where others conflate them is making a theoretical claim through semantic stipulation. Conversely, an author who strategically leaves boundaries fuzzy may be preserving argumentative flexibility—able to invoke the connotations of both concepts without committing to their distinction. This capability identifies which boundaries are weight-bearing for the argument (where a shift in boundary would change the conclusion) and which are ornamental. It feeds the inferential commitment mapper by identifying which conceptual distinctions carry logical commitments and which are merely nominal.

    Sophistication requires distinguishing acknowledged fuzziness from unacknowledged confusion. Wittgenstein's notion of family resemblance legitimizes certain kinds of conceptual blurriness—some concepts genuinely have no essence and their boundaries are necessarily vague. But other boundary problems reflect unresolved tensions or equivocations. A sophisticated analysis asks: is this boundary fuzziness the good Wittgensteinian kind (reflecting the concept's genuine structure) or the problematic kind (reflecting the author's failure to work through a distinction)? And it asks whether boundary ambiguities are exploited for argumentative advantage—terms strategically left undefined so they can bear multiple meanings across different parts of the argument.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: wittgenstein
    concept: family_resemblance
    method: Wittgenstein's argument that many concepts have no essential definitions but instead show
      family resemblances—overlapping similarities without a common core—licenses this capability's attention
      to legitimate conceptual fuzziness. It looks for where boundaries are necessarily blurred (because
      concepts overlap without clean separation) versus where they are strategically maintained as fuzzy,
      and distinguishes both from simple confusion.
  indicators:
  - Author uses two terms in close proximity without clearly distinguishing them, suggesting potential
    boundary fuzziness
  - Explicit discussion of what distinguishes one concept from another ('Power differs from authority
    in that...')
  - Author's usage suggests a concept's meaning shifts depending on whether it's being contrasted with
    concept A or concept B
  - Critiques of other scholars for conflating concepts the author wants to distinguish, or for distinguishing
    what the author wants to unify
  - Terms that appear to be used interchangeably in some contexts but carefully distinguished in others
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Note 2-3 most significant boundary cases where conceptual distinctions are unclear or contested,
      with examples of boundary behavior.
    standard: Map boundaries between all major concept pairs, documenting where boundaries are sharp vs.
      fuzzy, whether fuzziness is acknowledged, whether it appears strategic, and what argumentative work
      the boundary-drawing accomplishes.
    deep: Exhaustive boundary mapping with typology of boundary types (sharp/explicitly theorized, sharp/implicit,
      legitimately fuzzy, strategically ambiguous, confusedly blurred), comparison with how other authors
      draw the same boundaries, counterfactual analysis of how arguments would fail if boundaries were
      drawn differently, and assessment of whether boundary decisions reflect intellectual commitments
      or argumentative convenience.

It tracks how concepts actually behave in argumentative contexts—not how they are defined in the text's theoretical sections, but how they are deployed in analysis, applied in examples, wielded in critiques, and avoided in contexts where they might have been expected. The gap between definition and usage is often where a concept's real meaning emerges. An author might define 'rationality' abstractly as 'goal-oriented reasoning,' but consistently use it in contexts that imply calculative, means-ends reasoning specifically, never applying it to forms of practical wisdom or deliberation. That usage pattern reveals the operational meaning, which is narrower and more specific than the stated definition.

    This capability also detects meaning drift across a work—moments when a concept's usage subtly shifts as the argument progresses, accumulating new connotations or shedding old ones. It identifies contexts of heavy use (where the concept does the most argumentative work) and conspicuous absence (where you would expect the concept but the author avoids it, suggesting limitations or tensions). It distinguishes between constructive and critical deployment: Does the author use 'ideology' only when criticizing others, never when describing their own framework? That asymmetry is itself meaningful. For downstream engines, usage profiles provide the empirical reality check against which stated commitments can be tested. The inferential commitment mapper needs to know not what the author says a concept commits them to, but what their actual usage demonstrates it commits them to.

    The non-trivial challenge is distinguishing meaningful variation from natural linguistic flexibility. All language involves some contextual variation in concept deployment—that is how language works. A sophisticated analysis identifies patterns of systematic deviation: contexts where the concept reliably means something different, shifts that correlate with argumentative needs, or usages that directly contradict stated definitions. It also recognizes strategic concept avoidance—when an author's framework would seem to demand a certain concept but they systematically substitute a different one, revealing discomfort or suppressed tensions.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: wittgenstein
    concept: meaning_as_use
    method: Wittgenstein's dictum that 'meaning is use' in language games directly grounds this capability's
      prioritization of actual deployment over stated definition. The capability treats usage patterns—not
      dictionary entries or theoretical stipulations—as constitutive of meaning, and tracks how concepts
      function in the author's particular language game across different argumentative contexts.
  indicators:
  - Formal definition of a concept in theoretical sections followed by more specific or narrow usage in
    analytical sections
  - Concept used frequently in first half of text but fading or being replaced by different terminology
    in second half
  - 'Concept deployed asymmetrically: used to analyze others'' positions but not the author''s own, or
    vice versa'
  - Author's examples and case applications of a concept consistently emphasize certain dimensions while
    ignoring others mentioned in the definition
  - Contexts where you would expect a concept to appear based on the framework, but the author uses different
    terminology instead
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Note any significant gaps between definition and usage for 3-5 core concepts, with representative
      examples.
    standard: Track usage for all significant concepts through the work, documenting definition-usage
      gaps, meaning shifts across sections, contexts of heavy use vs. conspicuous absence, and asymmetric
      deployment (constructive vs. critical contexts).
    deep: Comprehensive usage tracking with statistical frequency analysis across argumentative contexts,
      detailed meaning drift mapping showing how concepts accumulate or shed connotations through the
      work, systematic cataloging of conspicuous absences with analysis of what concepts are used instead,
      comparison with how the same concepts are used by intellectual predecessors and contemporaries,
      and assessment of whether usage patterns reveal unacknowledged commitments or tensions in the framework.

  extended_description: |-
    This capability surfaces the evaluative and associative dimensions of concepts that operate below explicit argumentation—the affective loading, aesthetic associations, and ideological freight that do rhetorical work without justification. Lakoff's work on conceptual metaphors and framing reveals how much of political and analytical language carries implicit evaluations that pre-structure thought. When an author describes a policy as 'intervention' versus 'support,' or a social formation as 'organic' versus 'constructed,' or a theoretical approach as 'rigorous' versus 'systematic,' they are not making explicitly defended evaluative claims but selecting terms whose connotations do silent argumentative work. This capability maps that connotation landscape, asking: What evaluative charge do key terms carry? Are those charges consistent with the author's stated analytical neutrality, or do they smuggle in partisan judgments? How do the author's connotations differ from standard disciplinary usage—have they loaded previously neutral terms, or bleached previously loaded ones?

    Connotation mapping reveals the implicit rhetoric of conceptual choices. It identifies connotation-based pairs—terms that differ primarily in affective charge rather than denotation ('freedom fighter' vs. 'insurgent,' 'welfare' vs. 'dependency,' 'market' vs. 'capitalism'). These pairs are diagnostic of ideological position often more reliably than explicit argument. The capability also tracks emotional and aesthetic associations that shape reader response: Does 'community' carry warm, solidaristic connotations while 'collective' carries cold, impersonal ones? These associations structure how arguments land, making certain conclusions feel natural or attractive before any explicit reasoning occurs. For downstream engines, the connotation landscape reveals the pre-argumentative framework—the evaluative structure within which explicit reasoning operates.

    Sophistication requires distinguishing between unavoidable connotation (all language carries some affective charge) and strategic loading. It also demands assessing whether the argument could survive connotation-stripping. Some arguments genuinely depend on explicit reasoning and would hold if all connotations were neutralized. Others derive their persuasive force primarily from connotative selection, and would collapse if terms were replaced with neutral equivalents. A sophisticated analysis performs this counterfactual test: if we replace 'organic solidarity' with 'type-A social cohesion' and 'mechanical solidarity' with 'type-B social cohesion,' does Durkheim's argument still work? If not, how much work is the organic/mechanical metaphor doing, and is that work justified?
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: lakoff
    concept: conceptual_metaphor
    method: Lakoff's theory of conceptual metaphor—that abstract reasoning is structured by metaphorical
      mappings from concrete domains that carry evaluative and affective associations—grounds this capability's
      attention to how concept choice pre-structures thought. Metaphorical source domains (organism, machine,
      market, war) carry connotations that shape what seems natural, good, or possible before explicit
      argument begins.
  indicators:
  - Key concepts drawn from metaphorical source domains with strong affective associations (organic, mechanical,
    disease, health, war, game, market)
  - Pairs of near-synonyms where the author consistently chooses one with more positive or negative connotations
  - Terms used to describe the author's own position that differ in connotation from terms used for rival
    positions, even when denotation is similar
  - Explicit discussion of why certain terminology is politically or ideologically charged, with author
    either embracing or distancing from connotations
  - Concepts that appear to function as 'thick' ethical concepts—simultaneously descriptive and evaluative
    (e.g., 'exploitation,' 'flourishing,' 'corruption')
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Identify most obviously connotation-loaded terms (3-5), note whether loading is positive/negative,
      and whether it is explicitly acknowledged.
    standard: 'Map connotations for all significant concepts: evaluative charge (positive/negative/neutral/ambivalent),
      consistency with stated analytical neutrality, departure from standard disciplinary connotations,
      connotation-based pairs, and assessment of how connotations do argumentative work.'

      of the relationship between the author's explicit evaluative commitments and their implicit connotative
      choices.

      The architecture pass revealed tensions — boundary terms where
      concepts resist clean separation, clusters that compete rather
      than complement, usage patterns that contradict definitions. Now
      inhabit these tensions dialectically rather than resolving them.

      For each significant boundary tension, perform Aufhebung: the
      boundary between two concepts (say "power" and "authority") is
      not a line to be drawn but a productive zone where both concepts
      reveal their limitations. The author's inability to draw a clean
      boundary is not a failure of precision but a discovery — the
      boundary IS fuzzy because the phenomena resist the distinction
      the author needs. Articulate what the boundary tension reveals
      about the limits of the author's conceptual vocabulary.

      Where concept clusters compete — pulling the same terms toward
      different thematic centers — do not adjudicate which cluster the
      term "really" belongs to. Instead, trace what the competition
      reveals: a concept claimed by two clusters is doing double duty,
      and that double duty is often where the argument's real work
      happens. The concept's meaning is constituted by its tension
      between the clusters, not by its allegiance to either.

      Where usage contradicts definition, resist the temptation to
      declare one "real" and the other "misleading." The gap between
      definition and usage is itself a semantic fact — it reveals that
      the concept is richer (or more conflicted) than the author's
      explicit understanding of it. Trace what the concept is trying
      to become that its definition cannot yet accommodate.
