  Every academic text tells a story, even when it claims to merely present
  arguments. The narrative dimension — how authors construct temporal sequences,
  deploy voice, shift between registers, use storytelling as persuasive
  instrument — is analytically distinct from both logical structure and
  rhetorical strategy. A text may be logically impeccable and rhetorically
  effective while telling a story that undermines its own conclusions, or
  deploy a narrative mode that reveals commitments the explicit argument
  denies.

  Hayden White demonstrated that historical writing is always emplotted —
  organized according to narrative patterns (romance, tragedy, comedy, satire)
  that shape what can be said and how it's received. Genette showed that
  narrative is structured through focalization (whose perspective), temporal
  ordering (what comes when and why), and voice (who speaks and from where).
  Bakhtin revealed that texts are never monological but contain multiple
  competing voices (heteroglossia) even when they appear to speak with one.

  For academic texts, the narrative dimension is especially revealing because
  it's the layer authors are least conscious of controlling. An author who
  carefully constructs their logical argument may unconsciously adopt a
  prophetic voice that reveals messianic assumptions, or shift between
  analytical and confessional registers in ways that expose the personal
  stakes behind the scholarly claims. The gap between a text's explicit
  argumentative structure and its implicit narrative structure is often
  where the most analytically productive tensions reside.

researcher_question: How does this text construct its narrative, and what does the narrative structure reveal about the argument?

intellectual_lineage:
  primary:
    name: white
    description: Hayden White (1928-2018), American historian and literary critic whose Metahistory demonstrated that all historical writing is structured by narrative patterns (emplotment) — romance, tragedy, comedy, satire — that shape what can be said and how it's received. His work revealed that the choice of narrative mode is itself an interpretive act, not a neutral container for content, fundamentally reshaping how we understand the relationship between narrative and argument in scholarly writing.
  secondary:
    - name: genette
      description: Gérard Genette (1930-2018), French literary theorist whose Narrative Discourse provided the foundational vocabulary for analyzing narrative structure — focalization (who sees), voice (who speaks), temporal ordering (what comes when), and mood (at what distance). His technical apparatus enables precise analysis of narrative choices that would otherwise remain invisible.
    - name: bakhtin
      description: Mikhail Bakhtin (1895-1975), Russian literary theorist whose concepts of heteroglossia (multiple voices within a text), dialogism (every utterance responds to prior utterances), and chronotope (the inseparability of time and space in narrative) provide tools for analyzing the polyphonic dimension of academic texts — the competing voices that inhabit even apparently monological scholarly prose.
    - name: ricoeur
      description: Paul Ricoeur (1913-2005), French philosopher whose Time and Narrative demonstrated the deep connection between temporal experience and narrative structure, arguing that narrative is the primary means by which humans make sense of time — essential for understanding how academic texts construct their relationship to past, present, and future.
    - name: booth
      description: Wayne C. Booth (1921-2005), American literary critic whose The Rhetoric of Fiction analyzed how narrative techniques serve persuasive purposes — the implied author, the unreliable narrator, and the relationship between narrator and audience — providing tools for understanding the persuasive dimension of narrative choices in academic texts.
  traditions:
    - name: narratology
      description: The formal study of narrative structure and its effects, drawing on structuralist and post-structuralist traditions to analyze how stories are constructed, what choices are made in their telling, and what those choices reveal about the narrator's commitments, assumptions, and rhetorical strategies.
    - name: metahistory
      description: White's approach to historical writing as structured by literary forms, revealing that the choice of emplotment (romance, tragedy, comedy, satire) is itself an interpretive act that shapes what can be said and how it's received — applicable to any extended scholarly argument that deploys historical narrative.
    - name: reception_theory
      description: The tradition from Iser and Jauss analyzing how texts construct their implied reader, create gaps and indeterminacies that the reader must fill, and manage the reader's expectations — essential for understanding how academic texts manage their audience's interpretive trajectory.
    - name: discourse_analysis
      description: The analysis of how language use in context constructs social realities, positioning speakers and hearers in particular relationships — applicable to understanding how academic texts construct their narrative authority and manage register shifts.
  key_concepts:
    - name: emplotment
      definition: White's concept for the narrative structuring of events into a story — the selection of a narrative mode (romance, tragedy, comedy, satire) that determines how events are organized, what counts as a beginning/middle/end, and what kind of meaning the sequence produces.
    - name: focalization
      definition: Genette's concept for the relationship between the narrator and the characters or events narrated — who sees (perceptual focalization) and who knows (cognitive focalization). In academic texts, this translates to whose perspective is centered, what the narrator claims to know, and whose viewpoint is marginalized.
    - name: heteroglossia
      definition: Bakhtin's concept for the multiplicity of voices within any text — even apparently monological scholarly prose contains competing discourses, registers, and speech genres that create internal dialogism.
    - name: narrative_tension
      definition: The productive conflict between competing narrative impulses within a text — between story and argument, between different registers, between the demands of narrative coherence and analytical precision.
    - name: temporal_construction
      definition: How a text constructs its relationship to time — whether it presents events as linear progression, cyclical return, genealogical descent, dialectical movement, or catastrophic rupture, and what this temporal frame reveals about the text's implicit philosophy of history.
