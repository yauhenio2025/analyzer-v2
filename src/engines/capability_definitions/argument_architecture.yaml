  Arguments are not merely assertions strung together. They are architectural structures—load-bearing edifices where some elements support others, where hidden connectors hold the visible parts in place, and where the strength of the whole depends on the weakest joint. Most reasoning presents itself as a seamless flow from evidence to conclusion, but beneath this surface lies a complex scaffolding of warrants, backing, qualifications, and rebuttals. The central problem this engine addresses is the invisibility of argumentative structure: how claims that appear self-evident actually rest on unstated principles, how evidence that seems decisive depends on suppressed premises, how the very patterns of reasoning—the argumentation schemes—shape what counts as good evidence in the first place.

  What most readers miss is the architecture itself. They see the claim and perhaps the evidence, but they do not see the warrant—the often-unstated principle that licenses the move from evidence to conclusion. They do not see the backing that supports the warrant, or the qualifiers that hedge the claim, or the rebuttals that acknowledge exceptions. Most crucially, they do not see the argumentation schemes: the recurring patterns of reasoning (argument from authority, argument from analogy, argument from sign, argument from consequence) that structure how we move from premises to conclusions. Each scheme carries its own critical questions—the specific challenges that can defeat that type of argument. An argument from expert opinion, for instance, is vulnerable to questions about the expert's credentials, potential bias, and whether other experts disagree. Without recognizing the scheme, one cannot ask the right questions.

  The philosophical foundations run deep. Stephen Toulmin's revolutionary model (1958) broke with formal logic's obsession with validity to ask how arguments actually work in practice—revealing the warrant-ground-backing-qualifier-rebuttal structure that organizes real reasoning. Douglas Walton's systematic taxonomy of argumentation schemes identified dozens of recurring reasoning patterns, each with characteristic critical questions. The pragma-dialectical school of van Eemeren and Grootendorst treated argumentation as a critical discussion governed by rules, where fallacies are violations of those rules. Informal logic, developed by Johnson and Blair, provided methods for evaluating arguments that formal logic cannot capture—questions of relevance, sufficiency, and acceptability that determine whether an argument actually works.

  Within the logic suite, this engine provides the foundational structural analysis that other engines build upon. Where dialectical_structure_analyzer maps the exchange between positions, this engine first reveals what those positions actually argue and how. Where inferential_commitment_mapper traces what you are committed to when you accept a claim, this engine first identifies what claims are being made and how they are supported. Where counterfactual_analyzer examines conditional reasoning, this engine identifies when and how such reasoning appears in actual arguments. The argument architecture is the skeleton; other engines examine the muscles, nerves, and circulation.

  Commitment to architectural analysis matters because bad arguments do not announce themselves. They hide their weakness in unstated warrants, in undefended backing, in qualifications quietly dropped, in rebuttals never considered. The arguer may not even know where the weakness lies—they inherit schemes and warrants from their intellectual tradition without examining them. Mapping the architecture is the first step toward genuine critical engagement: you cannot challenge what you cannot see, and you cannot see what you have not learned to look for. This engine teaches the eye to see the bones beneath the flesh of any argument.

  primary:
    name: toulmin
    description: 'Stephen Toulmin (1922–2009), British philosopher whose The Uses
      of Argument (1958) revolutionized argumentation theory by breaking with formal
      logic''s exclusive focus on validity. Toulmin observed that real arguments in
      law, science, and everyday life do not fit the syllogistic mold—they have warrants
      (principles licensing inferences), backing (support for warrants), qualifiers
      (hedges on certainty), and rebuttals (acknowledged exceptions). This field-dependent
      model of argument provides the engine''s core structural vocabulary and its
      fundamental insight: that the unstated warrant is often the most important and
      vulnerable element of any argument.'
  secondary:
  - name: walton
    description: Douglas Walton (1942–2020), Canadian philosopher who systematically
      catalogued argumentation schemes—recurring patterns of reasoning like argument
      from authority, analogy, sign, and consequence. Each scheme comes with characteristic
      critical questions that probe its vulnerabilities. Walton's work provides this
      engine's scheme identification capability and its method of generating targeted
      challenges to specific argument types.
  - name: van_eemeren
    description: 'Frans van Eemeren (1946–), Dutch argumentation theorist who, with
      Rob Grootendorst, developed pragma-dialectics: a framework treating argumentation
      as rule-governed critical discussion aimed at resolving differences of opinion.
      Fallacies become rule violations rather than mere bad patterns. This tradition
      provides the engine''s understanding of dialectical obligations and its framework
      for assessing when arguers have met or failed their burdens.'
  - name: johnson
    description: Ralph Johnson (1940–) and J. Anthony Blair (1936–2023), Canadian
      philosophers who founded informal logic as a distinct field. Their work on the
      criteria of relevance, sufficiency, and acceptability (the RSA triangle) provides
      standards for evaluating arguments that formal validity cannot capture. This
      engine inherits their practical focus on what makes arguments actually work.
  - name: perelman
    description: Chaïm Perelman (1912–1984), Belgian philosopher whose New Rhetoric
      (with Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca) revived the study of argumentation addressed to
      particular audiences. His analysis of starting points, techniques of argumentation,
      and the role of values in reasoning informs the engine's attention to what audiences
      must accept for arguments to succeed.
  - name: aristotle
    description: Aristotle (384–322 BCE), whose Rhetoric and Topics catalogued the
      topoi—common patterns of argument—and whose analysis of enthymemes (arguments
      with suppressed premises) remains foundational. The engine's identification
      of suppressed premises and reconstruction of full argumentative form traces
      directly to Aristotelian method, as does attention to ethos, pathos, and logos
      as modes of persuasion.
  traditions:
  - name: informal_logic
    description: A movement emerging in the 1970s that rejected the adequacy of formal
      logic for evaluating real arguments. Informal logicians developed criteria like
      relevance, sufficiency, and acceptability, catalogued fallacies as argument
      defects rather than mere invalid forms, and insisted on the importance of context
      in argument evaluation. This tradition grounds the engine's practical evaluative
      framework.
  - name: pragma_dialectics
    description: The Amsterdam school approach treating argumentation as a critical
      discussion governed by rules designed to resolve differences of opinion. Ten
      rules specify what discussants may and may not do; fallacies are rule violations.
      This provides the engine's framework for dialectical obligations and its understanding
      of burden of proof as a normative concept.
  - name: rhetoric
    description: The ancient tradition stretching from Aristotle through Cicero, Quintilian,
      and into modern neo-Aristotelianism. Rhetoric studies how arguments are crafted
      for particular audiences, attending to invention (finding arguments), arrangement
      (structuring them), and style (expressing them). The engine inherits rhetoric's
      attention to audience, occasion, and strategic construction.
  - name: speech_act_theory
    description: The philosophical analysis of language as action, from Austin's performatives
      through Searle's taxonomy of speech acts. Arguing is itself a speech act with
      felicity conditions; claims, challenges, and concessions are moves in a language
      game. This tradition informs the engine's treatment of argumentative moves as
      actions with normative consequences.
  - name: legal_reasoning
    description: The jurisprudential tradition of analyzing how legal arguments work—from
      case-based reasoning to statutory interpretation, from burden of proof to standards
      of evidence. Legal practice provides concrete models for many argumentation
      concepts (burden, presumption, rebuttal, precedent) that the engine applies
      more broadly. Toulmin himself drew heavily on legal models.
  - name: fallacy_theory
    description: The long tradition of cataloguing argument defects, from Aristotle's
      Sophistical Refutations through medieval lists to modern taxonomies by Hamblin,
      Walton, and others. Recent work treats fallacies not as simple errors but as
      patterns that are sometimes legitimate, requiring contextual judgment. The engine
      uses this tradition for its fallacy detection capability.
  key_concepts:
  - name: warrant
    definition: 'The principle that licenses the inference from grounds to claim—the
      often-unstated rule that explains why the evidence supports the conclusion.
      Warrants are field-dependent: what counts as good reasoning in law differs from
      science differs from ethics. The warrant is frequently the most vulnerable and
      most invisible part of an argument.'
  - name: argumentation_scheme
    definition: A recurring pattern of reasoning with characteristic premises, conclusions,
      and critical questions. Schemes like argument from expert opinion, argument
      from analogy, and argument from sign are neither formally valid nor mere fallacies—they
      are defeasible reasoning patterns that work under certain conditions and fail
      under others. Identifying the scheme reveals which critical questions apply.
  - name: burden_of_proof
    definition: 'The obligation to provide sufficient support for a claim. Burden
      allocation depends on context: the prosecution bears it in criminal trials,
      the challenger bears it against established presumptions. Burden can shift during
      argument. Understanding who must prove what is essential to evaluating whether
      arguments succeed or fail.'
  - name: enthymeme
    definition: An argument with a suppressed premise—a conclusion drawn without explicitly
      stating all the premises needed to reach it. Aristotle identified the enthymeme
      as the heart of rhetorical reasoning. Reconstructing the suppressed premise
      reveals assumptions the arguer takes for granted, often controversial ones hidden
      by their absence.
  - name: rebuttal
    definition: Conditions or exceptions that defeat an otherwise successful argument.
      Acknowledging rebuttals shows intellectual honesty; ignoring applicable rebuttals
      is a weakness. Rebuttals may attack claims directly (rebutting defeaters) or
      undermine the warrant's applicability (undercutting defeaters).
  - name: critical_question
    definition: 'A question that probes a potential weakness in a particular argumentation
      scheme. Each scheme has characteristic critical questions: for argument from
      authority, questions about expertise and bias; for argument from analogy, questions
      about relevant similarity. Asking the right critical questions is the key to
      responsible evaluation.'
  - name: dialectical_obligation
    definition: What a participant in argumentative exchange must do to maintain their
      position responsibly. If challenged, one must defend or retract. If one makes
      a claim, one is obligated to support it if asked. Tracking obligations reveals
      where arguers have met or failed their responsibilities.
  - name: defeasibility
    definition: 'The property of conclusions that can be overturned by additional
      information without logical contradiction. Most real arguments are defeasible:
      they establish presumptive conclusions that hold unless and until contrary evidence
      emerges. Recognizing defeasibility prevents both overclaiming certainty and
      dismissing good-but-fallible reasoning.'
analytical_dimensions:
- key: structural_composition
  description: 'How the argument is built from components—claims, grounds, warrants,
    backing, qualifiers, and rebuttals. This dimension examines the architectural
    relationship between elements: which grounds support which claims, what warrants
    license which inferences, how backing supports warrants, and whether qualifiers
    and rebuttals are appropriately acknowledged.'
  probing_questions:
  - What is the main claim, and what type of claim is it (empirical, normative, causal)?
  - What grounds are offered, and how do they connect to the claim?
  - What warrant licenses the inference from grounds to claim, and is it stated or
    implicit?
  - What backing supports the warrant, and how strong is it?
  - What qualifiers hedge the claim, and what rebuttals acknowledge exceptions?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the main claim and the primary evidence offered for it.
    standard: Map the full Toulmin structure including warrants, backing, qualifiers,
      and rebuttals for major arguments.
    deep: Trace nested arguments where conclusions become grounds for further claims,
      identify implicit warrants and their backing, and assess where qualifiers and
      rebuttals are missing but needed.
- key: scheme_identification
  description: What patterns of reasoning structure the argument—argument from authority,
    analogy, sign, cause, consequence, and others. Each scheme has characteristic
    form and characteristic vulnerabilities. Identifying the scheme is the prerequisite
    for asking the right critical questions.
  probing_questions:
  - What argumentation schemes are employed (authority, analogy, sign, cause, etc.)?
  - Is the scheme being used appropriately for the context?
  - What are the critical questions specific to each scheme used?
  - Have the critical questions been adequately addressed?
  - Are multiple schemes combined, and if so, how do they interact?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the dominant argumentation scheme in the main argument.
    standard: Catalog all significant schemes used, state their critical questions,
      and assess whether those questions are addressed.
    deep: Analyze scheme combinations and transitions, evaluate why particular schemes
      were chosen (and what alternatives were available), and assess whether scheme
      choice reveals unstated assumptions about what counts as good evidence.
- key: attack_defense_dynamics
  description: How arguments engage each other through attack and defense. Attacks
    may target claims (rebutting), warrants (undercutting), or grounds (questioning
    evidence). Defenses respond through distinction, counter-example, additional support,
    or strategic concession. This dimension maps the adversarial structure of argumentation.
  probing_questions:
  - Where do arguments directly challenge other arguments?
  - What type of attack is employed—rebutting claims, undercutting warrants, or questioning
    grounds?
  - How do attacked arguments respond, if at all?
  - Are attacks successful in undermining their targets?
  - What strategic concessions are made, and do they strengthen or weaken the overall
    position?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify obvious points of disagreement and the main attack on the central
      claim.
    standard: Map the attack-defense structure showing which arguments target which,
      classify attack types, and assess defense adequacy.
    deep: Trace multi-move exchanges (attack-defense-counter-defense), identify missed
      attack opportunities, analyze strategic concessions for whether they actually
      serve the arguer's goals, and assess the overall balance of the argumentative
      exchange.
- key: burden_presumption_structure
  description: Who must prove what, what is taken for granted, and how burden shifts
    through the argument. Presumptions establish default positions that hold unless
    challenged; burden of proof determines who must provide sufficient support. This
    dimension reveals the normative framework governing what counts as successful
    argumentation.
  probing_questions:
  - Who bears the initial burden of proof, and is this appropriate?
  - What presumptions are operative—what is taken for granted without argument?
  - Does burden shift during the argument, and are such shifts legitimate?
  - What standard of proof applies—preponderance, clear and convincing, beyond reasonable
    doubt?
  - Are presumptions properly invoked, or are they smuggled in without acknowledgment?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify who is making claims that require support and what is assumed
      without argument.
    standard: Map burden allocation across the argument, identify significant presumptions
      and their justification, track burden-shifting moves.
    deep: Analyze whether burden allocation reflects appropriate dialectical norms
      for the context, identify illegitimate burden-shifting (deflecting rather than
      proving), and assess whether presumptions are genuinely shared or controversially
      smuggled in.
- key: suppressed_element_reconstruction
  description: What is left unsaid but necessary—suppressed premises in enthymemes,
    implicit warrants, unstated qualifications, unacknowledged exceptions. The most
    revealing analysis often involves reconstructing what the argument requires but
    does not state, exposing assumptions the arguer may not even recognize.
  probing_questions:
  - Where are conclusions drawn from incomplete explicit premises (enthymemes)?
  - What suppressed premises are required to make the argument valid or strong?
  - How controversial are the suppressed premises?
  - What qualifications should be present but are omitted?
  - What rebuttals should be acknowledged but are ignored?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify one or two obvious enthymemes and state their suppressed premises.
    standard: Systematically reconstruct suppressed premises, assess their acceptability,
      and note significant omitted qualifications and rebuttals.
    deep: Analyze why certain premises are suppressed (strategic concealment vs. genuine
      assumption of shared belief), trace how suppressed premises connect to larger
      ideological commitments, and identify the most consequential unstated assumptions.
- key: argument_quality_assessment
  description: Overall evaluation of argument strength using the criteria of relevance
    (do the grounds bear on the claim?), acceptability (are premises true or reasonable?),
    and sufficiency (is there enough support?). This dimension synthesizes structural
    analysis into evaluative judgment about where arguments succeed and fail.
  probing_questions:
  - Are the grounds relevant to the claim—do they actually bear on it?
  - Are the premises acceptable—true, reasonable, or at least arguable?
  - Is the support sufficient—enough to warrant the strength claimed?
  - What are the weakest points in the argument?
  - What would make the argument stronger?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Provide overall assessment of argument strength with key weaknesses noted.
    standard: Evaluate relevance, acceptability, and sufficiency for major arguments;
      identify the most vulnerable points.
    deep: Conduct granular RSA assessment for all significant arguments, rank vulnerabilities
      by severity, and provide constructive analysis of how arguments could be strengthened
      or what would defeat them.
capabilities:
- key: toulmin_structure_mapping
  description: 'Decomposes arguments into their Toulmin components: claim, grounds,
    warrant, backing, qualifier, and rebuttal.'
  extended_description: |-
    Stephen Toulmin's model emerged from dissatisfaction with formal logic's inability to capture how arguments actually work in fields like law, science, and ethics. Where syllogistic logic asks only about validity—whether the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises—Toulmin's model asks what licenses the inference (warrant), what supports that license (backing), how certain the conclusion is (qualifier), and what would defeat it (rebuttal).

    This capability systematically identifies each component, with particular attention to the warrant—the often-unstated principle that explains why the evidence supports the conclusion. Warrants are field-dependent: the warrant acceptable in legal reasoning differs from that acceptable in scientific reasoning differs from that acceptable in ethical reasoning. Exposing the warrant reveals what kind of inference is being made and what standards it should meet.

    The analysis also attends to what is missing. Arguments lacking qualifiers claim more certainty than they can support. Arguments lacking rebuttals ignore exceptions that might defeat them. Arguments with weak or absent backing for their warrants rest on shaky foundations. The full Toulmin structure reveals not just what is argued but what the argument needs and lacks.

  extended_description: |-
    Douglas Walton's systematic cataloguing of argumentation schemes provides a powerful tool for argument analysis. Unlike formal logic, which treats all valid arguments alike, scheme analysis recognizes that different patterns of reasoning have different vulnerabilities. Argument from expert opinion is challenged by questions about credentials and bias; argument from analogy by questions about relevant similarity; argument from sign by questions about the reliability of the indicator.

    This capability identifies which schemes are at work in an argument and generates the critical questions specific to those schemes. This is not mechanical: the same surface form may instantiate different schemes depending on context, and arguments often combine multiple schemes. The analysis must determine which scheme best characterizes the reasoning and whether its critical questions have been adequately addressed.

    Scheme analysis also reveals choices. Why did the arguer reason from authority rather than from evidence directly? Why analogy rather than cause? These choices may reflect the available evidence, the audience's expectations, or strategic calculation. Understanding the scheme is understanding the argumentative strategy.

  extended_description: |-
    Argumentation is inherently dialogical. Even a monological text anticipates objections, responds to rival positions, and defends against potential attacks. This capability maps the adversarial structure: which arguments attack which, how targets respond, and where exchanges remain unresolved.

    Attacks come in types. Rebutting defeaters directly challenge the claim: the conclusion is false. Undercutting defeaters challenge the inferential link: even if the premises are true, they don't support this conclusion. Attacks on grounds question whether the evidence is accurate or relevant. Each type requires different defensive responses.

    Defenses also vary. Distinction narrows the claim to avoid the attack. Counter-example shows the attack doesn't apply. Additional support provides more grounds. Strategic concession yields a point to strengthen the overall position—or sometimes, unintentionally, to undermine it. The attack-defense map reveals the structure of controversy: what is contested, what is conceded, and what hangs in the balance.

  description: Identifies who must prove what, what is presumed without argument,

  extended_description: |-
    The allocation of burden of proof is among the most consequential aspects of any argumentative exchange. Whoever bears the burden must provide sufficient support; whoever enjoys presumption wins if the burden is not met. Legal contexts make this explicit—the prosecution must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt—but every argument involves implicit burden allocation.

    This capability identifies initial burden allocation (usually falling on whoever challenges the status quo), tracks burden-shifting moves (legitimate or illegitimate), and exposes presumptions—what is taken for granted without argument. Presumptions are not mere assumptions; they are dialectically privileged starting points that stand unless and until defeated.

    Burden-shifting can be legitimate—once the proponent has provided prima facie support, the opponent must respond—or strategic—deflecting by demanding proof from the other side rather than providing it oneself. Identifying illegitimate burden-shifting is a key diagnostic for argumentative bad faith.

  description: Identifies arguments with suppressed premises and reconstructs the
    full logical form.
  extended_description: |-
    Aristotle recognized that rhetorical arguments typically omit premises that audiences will supply. The enthymeme—the 'rhetorical syllogism'—draws conclusions without stating all the premises needed to reach them. This is not a flaw but a feature: audiences are more persuaded when they participate in completing the inference.

    But what is rhetorically effective can be analytically invisible. The suppressed premise is often the most controversial part of the argument—the part that would face the most resistance if stated openly. Reconstructing suppressed premises exposes what the argument takes for granted, often revealing assumptions the arguer themselves may not have explicitly considered.

    The reconstruction must be charitable but accurate: supply the premise that makes the argument strongest while remaining faithful to what the arguer seems to intend. The resulting explicit argument can then be evaluated: is that suppressed premise actually acceptable? If not, the argument fails—not because of what it says, but because of what it needs but cannot defend.

  description: Identifies argument defects that violate norms of good reasoning, with

  extended_description: |-
    The fallacy tradition stretches from Aristotle's Sophistical Refutations through medieval lists to modern taxonomies. But contemporary fallacy theory recognizes that most 'fallacies' are not always fallacious—they are patterns that can go wrong under certain conditions but may be legitimate under others. Appeal to authority is fallacious when the authority lacks relevant expertise; it is not fallacious when the authority is genuinely expert and the matter is within their competence.

    This capability identifies argument patterns that violate norms of good reasoning, but does so with attention to context. Is the ad hominem attack on the person's credibility relevant (the witness has a history of lying) or irrelevant (the scientist has unpopular political views)? Is the slippery slope argument evidence-based (there are genuine mechanisms linking A to Z) or merely alarmist?

    The pragma-dialectical approach treats fallacies as violations of discussion rules: reasonable rules that participants in a critical discussion should follow if they aim to resolve differences of opinion rationally. This provides a principled basis for distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate moves.
