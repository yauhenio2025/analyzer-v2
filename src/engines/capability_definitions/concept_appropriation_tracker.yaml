  Concepts do not stay where they were born. They migrate between
  contexts, mutate as they travel, get appropriated by new users,
  distorted by new purposes, and recombined into configurations their
  originators never imagined. When an author builds on their own prior
  work, every act of self-citation is also an act of self-appropriation:
  the author takes an idea from one context (the prior work) and places
  it in another (the current work), and in that transit, the idea changes.

  This engine tracks that transit. Building on the dimensional comparisons
  produced by concept_evolution (the first engine in the scanning chain),
  it adds the appropriation layer: not just HOW concepts changed between
  works, but the dynamics of that change. Was a concept faithfully
  carried forward, or was it adapted to serve a new purpose? Was the
  adaptation acknowledged, or was continuity asserted where change
  occurred? Were ideas borrowed from the author's own earlier work
  without acknowledgment -- and if so, why? Were they distorted in
  transit -- simplified, strawmanned, selectively quoted?

  The appropriation lens reveals the politics of self-relation. Authors
  are not neutral custodians of their own ideas. They have interests:
  establishing novelty (downplaying continuity), asserting consistency
  (downplaying change), building authority (curating which prior work
  to reference), and managing contradictions (burying inconvenient
  earlier positions). This engine maps those dynamics.

  It is the SECOND engine in the prior work scanning chain (Pass 2).
  It runs once per prior work, consuming concept_evolution's output and
  adding migration paths, semantic mutations, appropriation patterns,
  distortion maps, recombination analysis, and acknowledgment status.

  description: |
    Where did concepts move? Map the journey of each key concept from its location in the prior work to its location in the current work. A concept's migration path includes not just origin and destination but the mechanism of travel: was it explicitly cited, silently borrowed, independently rediscovered, or unconsciously absorbed?
  probing_questions:
  - Which concepts from the prior work appear in the current work?
  - How did each concept travel -- explicit citation, silent borrowing, or unconscious
    absorption?
  - Did concepts migrate directly, or through intermediate works?
  - Were concepts transplanted whole, or did only fragments survive the journey?
  - What was the context of origin and the context of arrival -- how different are
    they?

      between origin and destination, and assessment of whether the migration preserved

      intermediate stops, contextual analysis of origin and destination, assessment
      of what survived transit and what was lost, and comparison of the author''s

- key: semantic_mutations
  description: |
    How did meaning change during migration? When a concept moves from one work to another, it undergoes semantic mutation. The mutation may be extension (broadening), restriction (narrowing), metaphorization (becoming figurative), distortion (warping), or inversion (meaning the opposite). Each mutation type has different implications for genealogical analysis.
  probing_questions:
  - For each migrated concept, what changed in its meaning?
  - What type of mutation occurred -- extension, restriction, metaphorization, distortion,
    inversion?
  - Was the mutation gradual or sudden? Acknowledged or concealed?
  - Does the mutation serve the argument (strategic) or appear accidental (drift)?
  - How does the mutation relate to the dimensional changes identified by concept_evolution?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the most significant semantic mutations with before/after meanings
    standard: Map mutations with type classification, before/after meanings, evidence
      from both texts, and assessment of whether mutations were strategic or accidental
    deep: 'Full mutation analysis: every semantic change catalogued with type, degree,
      directionality, motivation (strategic vs. drift), relationship to vocabulary/methodology/metaphor/framing
      changes from concept_evolution, and patterns across mutations (does the author
      tend toward certain mutation types?)'
- key: appropriation_patterns
  description: |
    What was borrowed, and how was it used? Appropriation goes beyond mere migration: it involves taking a concept and making it serve a new purpose. The appropriation may be faithful (preserving the original intent), adapted (modifying for new context), distorted (warping beyond recognition), or inverted (using against its original purpose). In self-genealogy, authors appropriate from their own past selves.
  probing_questions:
  - What concepts were appropriated from the prior work for new purposes?
  - Is each appropriation faithful, adapted, distorted, or inverted relative to the
    original?
  - What new purpose does the appropriated concept serve?
  - Does the appropriation strengthen or weaken the original concept?
  - Is the author aware of the appropriation, or do they present borrowed material
    as new?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the most obvious appropriations with original and new purpose
    standard: Map appropriations with relationship-to-original classification, evidence
      for each, assessment of whether the appropriation is legitimate or questionable,
      and the new purpose served
    deep: 'Full appropriation analysis: every borrowing catalogued with fidelity classification,
      purpose analysis, legitimacy assessment, impact on both the original and new
      context, and patterns of appropriation (does the author tend to appropriate
      faithfully or creatively?)'
- key: distortion_map
  description: |
    How were ideas warped in transit? Distortion is a specific and important form of semantic mutation: the concept is not just changed but degraded -- oversimplified, strawmanned, selectively quoted, or inverted. In self-genealogy, distortion reveals interesting dynamics: an author may distort their own earlier positions to make current positions look more novel or more consistent than they are.
  probing_questions:
  - Are any concepts from the prior work distorted in the current work?
  - What type of distortion -- oversimplification, strawmanning, selective quotation,
    inversion?
  - Who benefits from the distortion -- does it serve the current argument?
  - Is the distortion likely intentional (strategic) or unintentional (forgetting,
    drift)?
  - How would the current argument change if the distortion were corrected?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note any obvious distortions
    standard: Map distortions with type, original vs. distorted meaning, evidence,
      likely motivation, and impact on the current argument
    deep: 'Full distortion analysis: every distortion catalogued with type, degree,
      motivation, beneficiary, impact assessment, and counterfactual (what changes
      if the distortion is corrected). Assessment of whether distortion patterns reveal
      systematic bias in how the author relates to their own past work'
- key: recombination
  description: |
    What new combinations of old ideas have been created? One of the most creative acts in intellectual work is recombination: taking elements from different prior works (or different parts of the same prior work) and combining them into something new. The recombination may produce genuine novelty -- or it may produce the illusion of novelty through rearrangement.
  probing_questions:
  - Are ideas from the prior work combined with ideas from other sources in the current
    work?
  - Are elements from different parts of the prior work recombined in new ways?
  - Does the recombination produce genuine novelty or rearrangement?
  - Are the recombined elements compatible, or does their combination create tensions?
  - Does the author acknowledge the recombinatory nature of their innovation?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note any obvious recombinations of prior ideas
    standard: Map recombinations with source elements, the new combination, assessment
      of genuine novelty vs. rearrangement, and any tensions introduced
    deep: 'Full recombination analysis: all identifiable recombinations catalogued
      with source elements traced to specific prior works, novelty assessment, tension
      analysis, acknowledgment status, and evaluation of the author''s recombinatory
      style (are they a synthesizer, a bricoleur, a system-builder?)'
- key: acknowledgment_status
  description: |
    What is cited and what is suppressed? The politics of self-citation are revealing. Authors choose which prior work to reference and which to leave unmentioned. Cited borrowings assert continuity and build authority. Uncited borrowings may indicate embarrassment, desire for novelty, strategic distancing, or genuine forgetting. The pattern of acknowledgment and suppression is itself genealogical evidence of the first order.
  probing_questions:
  - Which borrowings from the prior work are explicitly cited in the current work?
  - Which borrowings are uncited -- present but unacknowledged?
  - What pattern explains the acknowledgment decisions -- what is the logic of citation?
  - Does non-acknowledgment correlate with distortion (suppress what you've warped)?
  - What would change in how we read the current work if all debts were acknowledged?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note whether major borrowings are cited or uncited
    standard: Map acknowledgment status for each identified borrowing, hypothesize
      reasons for non-acknowledgment, and assess whether the pattern serves the author's
      rhetorical goals
    deep: 'Full acknowledgment analysis: every borrowing classified as cited/uncited/partially-cited,
      pattern analysis (what determines citation?), correlation with distortion and
      appropriation patterns, strategic interpretation of the acknowledgment pattern,
      and assessment of what the pattern reveals about the author''s self-relation'

    mechanisms of travel and contextual differences
  produces_dimensions:
  - migration_paths
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability maps the journey of concepts from their location in the prior work to their appearance in the current work, attending not merely to presence or absence but to the mechanisms and conditions of travel. Drawing on Derrida's theory of iterability—the principle that every repetition of a sign is also an alteration—it recognizes that when an author re-uses their own concept, they are not simply transporting a stable meaning but re-inscribing it in a new context where it inevitably takes on new valences. The capability distinguishes between explicit citation (where continuity is asserted), silent borrowing (where the debt is concealed), and unconscious absorption (where the author may not recognize their own influence on themselves). Each mechanism reveals different dynamics of self-relation: citation builds authority and continuity, silent borrowing suggests strategic distancing or novelty-seeking, and unconscious absorption points to foundational patterns that operate below the threshold of awareness.

    This capability provides the essential infrastructure for all other appropriation analyses. Without mapping where concepts actually moved, we cannot assess how they mutated (semantic_mutations), why they were borrowed (appropriation_patterns), whether they were distorted (distortion_map), or what was cited versus suppressed (acknowledgment_status). It transforms the dimensional comparisons from concept_evolution—which tell us WHAT changed—into a genealogical narrative of transit that tells us HOW and WHY concepts traveled. The sophistication of this capability lies in recognizing that concepts rarely migrate cleanly: they may move in fragments, travel through intermediate works, or arrive disguised under new terminology while retaining their functional role in the argument.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: derrida
    concept: iterability
    method: 'Derrida''s iterability shows that every instance of repetition is constitutively
      different from what it repeats, because context is never fully determinable
      or controllable. This capability applies that insight to self-citation: each
      time an author re-uses their own concept, it is iteration not identity, and
      the differences that emerge in transit are genealogically revealing.'
  indicators:
  - The current work uses terminology or concepts that closely resemble phrasing from
    the prior work, but without explicit citation
  - The author makes claims that depend on arguments previously established in the
    prior work, creating conceptual dependencies
  - Key terms appear in both works but with different surrounding vocabulary or argumentative
    contexts
  - The current work's structure or methodology echoes approaches developed in the
    prior work
  - Footnotes or citations reference the prior work but do not fully capture the extent
    of conceptual borrowing

  description: Classify how meaning changed during migration -- extension, restriction,
    metaphorization, distortion, inversion
  produces_dimensions:
  - semantic_mutations
  requires_dimensions:
  - migration_paths
  extended_description: |-
    This capability tracks how meaning shifts as concepts move between contexts, recognizing that semantic change is not random drift but patterned transformation that reveals intellectual development, strategic repositioning, or unconscious evolution. It classifies mutations into types—extension (broadening scope), restriction (narrowing application), metaphorization (literalizing or figuralizing), distortion (systematic warping), and inversion (meaning reversal)—because different mutation types have different genealogical implications. A concept that undergoes extension may indicate growing confidence or ambition; one that suffers restriction may reveal the discovery of limits or counterexamples. Metaphorization often signals disciplinary border-crossing (as concepts move from technical to popular registers or vice versa), while inversion suggests fundamental repositioning. The capability distinguishes strategic mutations (serving the current argument's needs) from drift (accidental semantic slippage over time), a distinction central to understanding authorial agency in self-genealogy.

    Semantic mutations are the mechanism by which appropriation happens: you cannot assess appropriation fidelity without knowing what semantic changes occurred. This capability builds directly on migration_paths (you must know a concept traveled before you can track how it changed) and feeds into appropriation_patterns (classifying whether borrowings are faithful, adapted, or distorted depends on mutation analysis) and distortion_map (distortion is a severe form of mutation). The sophistication lies in recognizing that mutations are often partial and multi-directional: a concept may be extended in one dimension while restricted in another, or metaphorized for some purposes while remaining literal for others. Tracking these complex mutation patterns reveals the conceptual labor involved in maintaining coherence across works.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: bakhtin
    concept: heteroglossia
    method: Bakhtin's heteroglossia demonstrates that words carry multiple, stratified
      meanings depending on their contexts of use, and that meaning is dialogically
      constituted through interaction between utterances. This capability treats each
      re-use of a concept as a dialogic event where the prior meaning encounters the
      new context, producing semantic mutation through their interaction.
  indicators:
  - The same term is used in both works but with noticeably different scope or application
    range
  - A concept that was literal/technical in the prior work becomes metaphorical/figurative
    in the current work, or vice versa
  - The current work defines or explains a concept differently than the prior work
    did, even if implicitly
  - Examples or illustrations used for a concept in the current work differ significantly
    from those in the prior work, suggesting shifted meaning
  - The concept's relationship to other concepts has changed (what it's opposed to,
    what it's aligned with, what it presupposes)
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Identifies the most significant semantic mutations with simple before/after
      meaning descriptions

    and legitimacy

  extended_description: |-
    This capability assesses how borrowed concepts are put to work in new contexts, evaluating not just that borrowing occurred but the purpose it serves and the fidelity with which it was executed. Drawing on Harold Bloom's anxiety of influence, it recognizes that appropriation is never neutral: authors relate to their sources (including their own prior selves) through complex dynamics of fidelity and deviation, reverence and rebellion. The capability classifies appropriations as faithful (preserving original intent and function), adapted (modified for new context but recognizably continuous), distorted (warped beyond the original's parameters), or inverted (turned against its original purpose). Each classification carries different implications: faithful appropriation suggests cumulative knowledge-building, adaptation indicates contextual sensitivity, distortion may signal forgetting or strategic misreading, and inversion points to fundamental intellectual reorientation. The capability also assesses legitimacy: is the appropriation intellectually honest, does it strengthen or weaken the original concept, and does the author acknowledge the appropriative nature of their move?

    This capability synthesizes migration_paths (where concepts moved) and semantic_mutations (how they changed) into a judgment about the character of borrowing. It feeds directly into acknowledgment_status (citation patterns correlate with appropriation fidelity) and provides crucial context for distortion_map (distortion is failed or weaponized appropriation). The sophistication of this capability lies in recognizing that appropriation exists on a spectrum rather than in discrete categories, and that authors appropriate differently from themselves than from others—self-appropriation may be more unconscious, more taken-for-granted, and thus more prone to unacknowledged drift. By cataloguing appropriation patterns across multiple works, the capability reveals an author's characteristic style of self-relation: are they faithful stewards of their own ideas, creative adapters, strategic revisers, or forgetful wanderers?
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: bloom
    concept: anxiety_of_influence
    method: Bloom's theory of poetic influence describes how later poets struggle
      with their precursors through characteristic misreadings (clinamen, tessera,
      kenosis, etc.). This capability adapts Bloom's framework to self-influence,
      recognizing that authors also struggle with their own prior works, appropriating
      from themselves through similar dynamics of creative misreading, though with
      different motivations (establishing novelty vs. consistency).
  indicators:
  - A concept from the prior work is applied to a significantly different domain or
    problem in the current work
  - The current work uses a concept in ways that seem to stretch or strain its original
    definition
  - The function a concept performs in the argument has shifted (e.g., from foundational
    premise to illustrative example, or vice versa)
  - The current work selectively emphasizes certain aspects of a prior concept while
    ignoring others
  - The concept is embedded in a new argumentative or methodological framework that
    changes its implications

      purpose noted

    strawmanned, selectively quoted, or inverted
  produces_dimensions:
  - distortion_map
  requires_dimensions:
  - semantic_mutations
  extended_description: |-
    This capability identifies cases where concepts from the prior work have been degraded, simplified, or warped in ways that misrepresent their original form and function. Distortion is a specific and particularly revealing form of semantic mutation: it involves not just change but damage to the concept's integrity. Drawing on Said's concept of traveling theory, which shows how ideas become vulgarized or domesticated as they move between contexts, this capability recognizes that authors can distort their own earlier work—sometimes strategically (to make current positions appear more novel or more consistent than they are), sometimes unconsciously (through forgetting, simplification, or selective memory). The capability classifies distortion types: oversimplification (reducing complexity to a slogan), strawmanning (presenting the prior position in its weakest form), selective quotation (cherry-picking passages that support current views), and inversion (attributing to the prior work a position it explicitly rejected). Each distortion type suggests different genealogical dynamics: oversimplification may indicate popularization or impatience with nuance, strawmanning suggests anxiety about past commitments, selective quotation reveals strategic reading, and inversion points to repressed tensions.

    Distortion analysis depends on semantic_mutations (distortion is severe mutation) but adds a normative dimension: not just how meaning changed but whether it was degraded. This capability feeds into appropriation_patterns (distorted appropriations are illegitimate) and acknowledgment_status (authors may suppress what they've distorted). The sophistication lies in distinguishing intentional from unintentional distortion—a distinction that requires assessing whether the distortion serves the current argument's rhetorical needs. The capability also performs counterfactual analysis: how would the current argument change if the distortion were corrected? This reveals what the distortion accomplishes and whether the current position depends on misrepresenting the past. Patterns of distortion across multiple works reveal systematic biases in how an author relates to their intellectual history.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: said
    concept: traveling_theory
    method: Said's account of how theories change as they travel between contexts—often
      losing their critical edge and becoming domesticated—illuminates how an author's
      own concepts can be distorted in transit between their works. The capability
      treats each instance of self-appropriation as a case of traveling theory, asking
      what gets lost, simplified, or vulgarized as ideas move through the author's
      corpus.
  indicators:
  - The current work attributes a simpler or more extreme position to the prior work
    than the prior work actually held
  - Complex arguments from the prior work are reduced to single claims or catchphrases
    in the current work
  - The current work quotes the prior work selectively in ways that obscure important
    qualifications or counterarguments
  - The current work presents as continuous with the prior work while quietly reversing
    or contradicting key claims
  - The current work uses the prior work as a foil or negative example in ways that
    seem ungenerous or inaccurate
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Notes any obvious distortions where current representation clearly mismatches
      prior work's actual position
    standard: Maps all identifiable distortions with type classification (oversimplification/strawmanning/selective
      quotation/inversion), evidence from both texts, likely motivation (strategic
      vs. forgetting), and impact on current argument

      degree, motivation, beneficiary analysis, impact assessment, counterfactual

    genuine novelty or rearrangement
  produces_dimensions:

  requires_dimensions:
  - migration_paths
  extended_description: |-
    This capability identifies moments where the author synthesizes elements from different sources—including different parts of the prior work, or elements from the prior work combined with material from other sources—into new configurations. Drawing on Lévi-Strauss's concept of bricolage and Latour's actor-network theory, it recognizes that intellectual creativity often consists not in generating entirely new concepts but in recombining existing elements in productive ways. The capability distinguishes genuine novelty (where recombination produces emergent properties that exceed the sum of parts) from mere rearrangement (where elements are shuffled without fundamental transformation). It tracks the source elements of each recombination, assesses compatibility (do the recombined elements fit together smoothly or create productive tensions?), and evaluates whether the author acknowledges the recombinatory nature of their innovation. In self-genealogy, recombination reveals how authors build on their own foundations: cumulative thinkers tend to recombine elements from multiple prior works into increasingly complex syntheses, while dialectical thinkers may recombine elements in ways that generate contradictions they then work to resolve.

    Recombination analysis depends on migration_paths (you must track where elements came from) but adds a synthetic dimension: not just where concepts moved but how they were combined with others. It complements semantic_mutations (which tracks change) by tracking assembly and composition. The capability feeds into the broader question of intellectual development: is this author's trajectory one of progressive synthesis (building ever-larger structures from prior elements) or iterative exploration (recombining the same basic elements in different ways)? The sophistication lies in recognizing that recombination operates at multiple levels—concepts can be recombined, but so can methods, metaphors, and argumentative structures. Some recombinations are explicitly thematized (the author announces their synthetic ambitions), while others are implicit (the synthesis happens in practice without being named).
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: latour
    concept: network_reconfiguration
    method: Latour's actor-network theory shows how innovation consists in reconfiguring
      networks of associations between heterogeneous elements. This capability treats
      each new work as a reconfiguration of the network established in prior works,
      tracing which elements are carried forward, which new elements are introduced,
      and how their reassembly produces (or fails to produce) novelty.
  indicators:
  - The current work brings together concepts from the prior work that were previously
    treated in separate chapters or sections
  - Arguments from the prior work are combined with theoretical frameworks or empirical
    material from other sources
  - The current work synthesizes distinctions or taxonomies from the prior work in
    new ways
  - Methodological approaches from the prior work are applied to new domains or combined
    with new techniques
  - The current work explicitly announces a synthetic ambition (e.g., 'bringing together
    my earlier work on X with recent developments in Y')

  extended_description: |-
    This capability maps the politics of self-citation: which borrowings from the prior work are explicitly acknowledged through citation or reference, which are silently incorporated, and what logic governs these decisions. Drawing on Bourdieu's sociology of intellectual fields, it recognizes that citation is not merely a neutral scholarly practice but a strategic act within an economy of credit, authority, and positioning. Authors choose which prior work to reference in ways that serve their current rhetorical and institutional goals: citing establishes continuity and builds on accumulated authority, while suppressing citations can create the appearance of novelty, distance the author from positions they now reject, or conceal contradictions. In self-genealogy, these dynamics become particularly interesting because the author controls both the cited and citing text—they are simultaneously creditor and debtor, and their citation decisions reveal how they wish to be read, which aspects of their intellectual history they embrace versus which they obscure.

    This capability synthesizes migration_paths (what was borrowed) and appropriation_patterns (how it was used) into an analysis of acknowledgment politics. It reveals correlations: do suppressed borrowings tend to be distorted ones? Are faithful appropriations more likely to be cited than adapted ones? The capability also performs counterfactual analysis: how would the current work be read differently if all debts were acknowledged? This exposes what the citation pattern accomplishes rhetorically. The sophistication lies in recognizing that acknowledgment operates on a spectrum—partial citation (referencing the prior work but understating the extent of borrowing), qualified citation (citing while emphasizing discontinuity), and strategic non-citation (where absence is meaningful)—and that patterns of acknowledgment across multiple works reveal an author's characteristic stance toward their own intellectual history. Some authors are scrupulous self-citers, others are strategic suppressors, and these styles of self-relation shape how their corpus coheres or fragments.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: bourdieu
    concept: symbolic_capital
    method: 'Bourdieu''s analysis of intellectual fields shows how citation practices
      function as exchanges of symbolic capital, establishing positions within networks
      of recognition and authority. This capability treats self-citation as a form
      of capital management: authors invest in certain aspects of their past work
      (through citation) while divesting from others (through suppression), strategically
      curating their intellectual identity.'
  indicators:
  - The current work makes claims or uses concepts that clearly derive from the prior
    work but without citing it
  - Footnotes reference the prior work but in contexts that understate the depth or
    breadth of the borrowing
  - The current work cites some aspects of the prior work while leaving closely related
    contributions unmentioned
  - Patterns of selective citation where certain chapters, arguments, or periods of
    the prior work are referenced while others are passed over
  - The current work's bibliography includes the prior work but the text itself makes

      Identify the most obvious concept migrations between prior and
      current work. For each migration, note the mechanism of travel
      (cited, silently borrowed, absorbed) and whether the concept
      was carried faithfully or adapted. Quick surface scan for the
      3-5 clearest cases.

      Map all significant migration paths with mechanisms of travel
      and contextual analysis. Classify semantic mutations by type
      (extension, restriction, metaphorization, distortion, inversion).
      Assess appropriation fidelity for each borrowed concept. Identify
      distortions with type, motivation, and impact. Map acknowledgment
      patterns revealing the politics of self-citation.

      Full Derridean iterability analysis in a single intensive pass.
      Every concept migration traced with mechanism, intermediate
      stops, and contextual analysis. Every semantic mutation classified
      and motivated (strategic vs. drift). Appropriation assessed for
      legitimacy with impact on both original and new context.
      Distortions catalogued with counterfactuals. Recombinations
      mapped with novelty assessment. Acknowledgment patterns analyzed
      for strategic logic, revealing the author's characteristic
      appropriation style.
