# THE WHAT: Rich Intellectual Description
# ============================================================

problematique: |
  Concepts do not stay where they were born. They migrate between
  contexts, mutate as they travel, get appropriated by new users,
  distorted by new purposes, and recombined into configurations their
  originators never imagined. When an author builds on their own prior
  work, every act of self-citation is also an act of self-appropriation:
  the author takes an idea from one context (the prior work) and places
  it in another (the current work), and in that transit, the idea changes.

  This engine tracks that transit. Building on the dimensional comparisons
  produced by concept_evolution (the first engine in the scanning chain),
  it adds the appropriation layer: not just HOW concepts changed between
  works, but the dynamics of that change. Was a concept faithfully
  carried forward, or was it adapted to serve a new purpose? Was the
  adaptation acknowledged, or was continuity asserted where change
  occurred? Were ideas borrowed from the author's own earlier work
  without acknowledgment -- and if so, why? Were they distorted in
  transit -- simplified, strawmanned, selectively quoted?

  The appropriation lens reveals the politics of self-relation. Authors
  are not neutral custodians of their own ideas. They have interests:
  establishing novelty (downplaying continuity), asserting consistency
  (downplaying change), building authority (curating which prior work
  to reference), and managing contradictions (burying inconvenient
  earlier positions). This engine maps those dynamics.

  It is the SECOND engine in the prior work scanning chain (Pass 2).
  It runs once per prior work, consuming concept_evolution's output and
  adding migration paths, semantic mutations, appropriation patterns,
  distortion maps, recombination analysis, and acknowledgment status.

analytical_dimensions:

  - key: migration_paths
    description: >
      Where did concepts move? Map the journey of each key concept from
      its location in the prior work to its location in the current work.
      A concept's migration path includes not just origin and destination
      but the mechanism of travel: was it explicitly cited, silently
      borrowed, independently rediscovered, or unconsciously absorbed?
    probing_questions:
      - "Which concepts from the prior work appear in the current work?"
      - "How did each concept travel -- explicit citation, silent borrowing, or unconscious absorption?"
      - "Did concepts migrate directly, or through intermediate works?"
      - "Were concepts transplanted whole, or did only fragments survive the journey?"
      - "What was the context of origin and the context of arrival -- how different are they?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "List the 3-5 most obvious concept migrations with origin and destination"
      standard: "Map migration paths with mechanisms of travel, contextual differences between origin and destination, and assessment of whether the migration preserved or transformed the concept"
      deep: "Full migration cartography: all concept movements traced with mechanisms, intermediate stops, contextual analysis of origin and destination, assessment of what survived transit and what was lost, and comparison of the author's migration patterns (do they tend to cite, borrow silently, or absorb unconsciously?)"

  - key: semantic_mutations
    description: >
      How did meaning change during migration? When a concept moves from
      one work to another, it undergoes semantic mutation. The mutation
      may be extension (broadening), restriction (narrowing),
      metaphorization (becoming figurative), distortion (warping), or
      inversion (meaning the opposite). Each mutation type has different
      implications for genealogical analysis.
    probing_questions:
      - "For each migrated concept, what changed in its meaning?"
      - "What type of mutation occurred -- extension, restriction, metaphorization, distortion, inversion?"
      - "Was the mutation gradual or sudden? Acknowledged or concealed?"
      - "Does the mutation serve the argument (strategic) or appear accidental (drift)?"
      - "How does the mutation relate to the dimensional changes identified by concept_evolution?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Identify the most significant semantic mutations with before/after meanings"
      standard: "Map mutations with type classification, before/after meanings, evidence from both texts, and assessment of whether mutations were strategic or accidental"
      deep: "Full mutation analysis: every semantic change catalogued with type, degree, directionality, motivation (strategic vs. drift), relationship to vocabulary/methodology/metaphor/framing changes from concept_evolution, and patterns across mutations (does the author tend toward certain mutation types?)"

  - key: appropriation_patterns
    description: >
      What was borrowed, and how was it used? Appropriation goes beyond
      mere migration: it involves taking a concept and making it serve
      a new purpose. The appropriation may be faithful (preserving the
      original intent), adapted (modifying for new context), distorted
      (warping beyond recognition), or inverted (using against its
      original purpose). In self-genealogy, authors appropriate from
      their own past selves.
    probing_questions:
      - "What concepts were appropriated from the prior work for new purposes?"
      - "Is each appropriation faithful, adapted, distorted, or inverted relative to the original?"
      - "What new purpose does the appropriated concept serve?"
      - "Does the appropriation strengthen or weaken the original concept?"
      - "Is the author aware of the appropriation, or do they present borrowed material as new?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Identify the most obvious appropriations with original and new purpose"
      standard: "Map appropriations with relationship-to-original classification, evidence for each, assessment of whether the appropriation is legitimate or questionable, and the new purpose served"
      deep: "Full appropriation analysis: every borrowing catalogued with fidelity classification, purpose analysis, legitimacy assessment, impact on both the original and new context, and patterns of appropriation (does the author tend to appropriate faithfully or creatively?)"

  - key: distortion_map
    description: >
      How were ideas warped in transit? Distortion is a specific and
      important form of semantic mutation: the concept is not just
      changed but degraded -- oversimplified, strawmanned, selectively
      quoted, or inverted. In self-genealogy, distortion reveals
      interesting dynamics: an author may distort their own earlier
      positions to make current positions look more novel or more
      consistent than they are.
    probing_questions:
      - "Are any concepts from the prior work distorted in the current work?"
      - "What type of distortion -- oversimplification, strawmanning, selective quotation, inversion?"
      - "Who benefits from the distortion -- does it serve the current argument?"
      - "Is the distortion likely intentional (strategic) or unintentional (forgetting, drift)?"
      - "How would the current argument change if the distortion were corrected?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Note any obvious distortions"
      standard: "Map distortions with type, original vs. distorted meaning, evidence, likely motivation, and impact on the current argument"
      deep: "Full distortion analysis: every distortion catalogued with type, degree, motivation, beneficiary, impact assessment, and counterfactual (what changes if the distortion is corrected). Assessment of whether distortion patterns reveal systematic bias in how the author relates to their own past work"

  - key: recombination
    description: >
      What new combinations of old ideas have been created? One of the
      most creative acts in intellectual work is recombination: taking
      elements from different prior works (or different parts of the
      same prior work) and combining them into something new. The
      recombination may produce genuine novelty -- or it may produce
      the illusion of novelty through rearrangement.
    probing_questions:
      - "Are ideas from the prior work combined with ideas from other sources in the current work?"
      - "Are elements from different parts of the prior work recombined in new ways?"
      - "Does the recombination produce genuine novelty or rearrangement?"
      - "Are the recombined elements compatible, or does their combination create tensions?"
      - "Does the author acknowledge the recombinatory nature of their innovation?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Note any obvious recombinations of prior ideas"
      standard: "Map recombinations with source elements, the new combination, assessment of genuine novelty vs. rearrangement, and any tensions introduced"
      deep: "Full recombination analysis: all identifiable recombinations catalogued with source elements traced to specific prior works, novelty assessment, tension analysis, acknowledgment status, and evaluation of the author's recombinatory style (are they a synthesizer, a bricoleur, a system-builder?)"

  - key: acknowledgment_status
    description: >
      What is cited and what is suppressed? The politics of self-citation
      are revealing. Authors choose which prior work to reference and
      which to leave unmentioned. Cited borrowings assert continuity
      and build authority. Uncited borrowings may indicate embarrassment,
      desire for novelty, strategic distancing, or genuine forgetting.
      The pattern of acknowledgment and suppression is itself genealogical
      evidence of the first order.
    probing_questions:
      - "Which borrowings from the prior work are explicitly cited in the current work?"
      - "Which borrowings are uncited -- present but unacknowledged?"
      - "What pattern explains the acknowledgment decisions -- what is the logic of citation?"
      - "Does non-acknowledgment correlate with distortion (suppress what you've warped)?"
      - "What would change in how we read the current work if all debts were acknowledged?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Note whether major borrowings are cited or uncited"
      standard: "Map acknowledgment status for each identified borrowing, hypothesize reasons for non-acknowledgment, and assess whether the pattern serves the author's rhetorical goals"
      deep: "Full acknowledgment analysis: every borrowing classified as cited/uncited/partially-cited, pattern analysis (what determines citation?), correlation with distortion and appropriation patterns, strategic interpretation of the acknowledgment pattern, and assessment of what the pattern reveals about the author's self-relation"
