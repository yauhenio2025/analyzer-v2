  All genealogical investigation converges here. The prior passes have
  done the archaeological work: discovering prior works, classifying
  relationships, scanning for dimensional traces, and analyzing
  conditions of possibility. Now the question becomes: what does it
  all MEAN? What is the comprehensive genealogical picture of this
  work's relationship to its author's prior intellectual output?

  This engine performs the most demanding intellectual operation in
  the genealogy pipeline: SYNTHESIS. Not mere aggregation -- not a
  compilation of findings from earlier passes -- but genuine intellectual
  synthesis that reveals patterns invisible in any single pass. The
  genealogical portrait must tell a STORY: how did this author's
  thinking evolve, what intellectual currents fed into the current
  work, where did ideas originate and how were they transformed,
  what debts remain unacknowledged, and what does all of this tell
  us about the nature of intellectual production itself?

  The synthesis operates at multiple scales simultaneously. At the
  macro scale: the author's overall intellectual trajectory and the
  current work's place within it. At the meso scale: per-idea
  genealogies showing how specific concepts, methods, and arguments
  evolved across works. At the micro scale: specific textual evidence
  grounding every claim. The challenge is maintaining coherence across
  these scales -- the macro narrative must be consistent with the
  micro evidence, and the meso genealogies must connect to both.

  Foucault's genealogical method insists that we attend not only to
  what persists but to what was abandoned, not only to acknowledged
  debts but to hidden ones, not only to the logic of ideas but to
  the material and institutional conditions that shaped them.
  Nietzsche's genealogy of morals taught us that the current meaning
  of a concept often conceals a completely different origin -- that
  genealogy is the art of revealing how things came to seem natural
  that were in fact contingent. Berlin's approach to intellectual
  history reminds us that ideas have CONSEQUENCES, that intellectual
  genealogies matter because they shape what people do, not just
  what they think.

  This engine must honor all three traditions: Foucault's attention
  to discontinuity and concealment, Nietzsche's suspicion toward
  apparent naturalness, and Berlin's insistence on the practical
  stakes of intellectual history.

    break, or synthesis?
  - What tensions in prior work does the current work resolve, and what new tensions
    does it create?
  - What is the relationship between intellectual evolution and institutional/career
    evolution?

  - What intellectual habits recur across works -- favorite moves, recurring strategies?
  - What are the author's characteristic strengths as revealed by genealogical analysis?
  - What blind spots or weaknesses persist across works?
  - How does the author handle intellectual debts -- generous acknowledgment, strategic
    concealment, genuine oversight?

  extended_description: |-
    This capability performs the most difficult distillation in the genealogical pipeline: reducing potentially decades of intellectual evolution into a narrative compact enough to fit in a busy reader's mind yet comprehensive enough to reorient their understanding of the current work. This is not mere summarization but what Foucault called 'effective history' (wirkliche Historie) in miniature—a compressed genealogical portrait that reveals how the present form of the author's thought emerged from contingent developments rather than teleological necessity. The summary must name the unacknowledged debts, the abandoned paths, and the transformations that made the current work possible, while remaining accessible to readers who may never engage the full genealogical apparatus.

    This capability serves as the primary interface between the genealogical investigation and its audiences. It must synthesize findings from all other capabilities—the narrative arc from genealogical_portrait, the specific conceptual transformations from idea_genealogies, the character patterns from author_intellectual_profile—into a coherent statement of what the genealogy reveals. Without this distillation, the genealogical labor remains trapped in specialist discourse; with it, the findings can reshape how scholars, students, and even the author themselves understand the work's intellectual provenance.

    The sophistication lies in what gets selected for inclusion. A naive summary merely lists influences chronologically; a genealogical summary identifies the ruptures, the concealed continuities, and the transformations that would most surprise or discomfit the author. It must capture both herkunft (descent, where ideas came from) and entstehung (emergence, the contingent circumstances of their appearance) while maintaining the narrative economy that makes it readable as a standalone text.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: foucault
    concept: effective_history
    method: 'Foucault''s effective history rejects teleological narratives in favor
      of revealing discontinuities, accidents, and power relations that shaped the
      present. This capability applies that method to distillation: the summary must
      highlight what was contingent, what was concealed, and what naturalized assumptions
      the genealogy denaturalizes.'
  indicators:
  - The current work presents itself as a natural evolution from prior work, suggesting
    a seamless narrative that conceals ruptures or abandonments
  - The author acknowledges some influences but the genealogical investigation reveals
    more significant unacknowledged debts
  - Multiple prior works contain seeds of current arguments in radically different
    forms, requiring synthesis to show transformation
  - The genealogy reveals institutional or career pressures that shaped intellectual
    choices but are invisible in the current work's self-presentation
  - Key concepts in the current work have complex evolutionary histories that would
    surprise readers treating them as straightforward
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Single paragraph identifying the most important genealogical finding—the
      one discovery that most changes how readers should understand the work's intellectual
      provenance.
    standard: Two to three paragraphs covering dominant influences, key evolutionary
      transformations, significant unacknowledged debts, and practical implications
      for how different audiences should read the work.
    deep: Three to four paragraphs with nuanced assessment of the trajectory's coherence,
      surprising findings that would discomfit the author, implications segmented
      by audience type (scholars, students, the author), and placement of this genealogy
      within broader disciplinary intellectual histories.

  description: Compose the main genealogical narrative tracing the author's intellectual
    trajectory through descent and emergence
  produces_dimensions:
  - genealogical_portrait
  requires_dimensions:
  - executive_summary
  extended_description: |-
    This capability constructs the main analytical narrative of the synthesis: a sustained genealogical account that traces the author's intellectual development from earliest relevant work to the present text. Unlike chronological intellectual biography, genealogical portraiture privileges descent (herkunft) and emergence (entstehung) over continuity and progress. It asks not 'how did the author steadily develop these ideas?' but 'under what contingent conditions did these ideas take the forms they did?' and 'what alternative paths were foreclosed by particular intellectual or institutional choices?' Drawing on Nietzsche's genealogical method, this narrative treats current meanings as potentially concealing radically different origins—the polished argument in the present work may have emerged from abandoned projects, responses to criticism, or institutional pressures invisible in the final text.

    This capability provides the narrative spine for the entire synthesis. Where idea_genealogies traces specific concepts and author_intellectual_profile characterizes thinking patterns, genealogical_portrait weaves these threads into a coherent story of intellectual becoming. It must maintain coherence across multiple temporal scales: the macro-arc from earliest to latest work, the meso-scale transformations where specific ideas changed character, and the micro-scale textual evidence grounding each claim. The portrait must also attend to what was abandoned—the promising lines of inquiry dropped, the methods forsaken, the questions left behind—because these abandonments reveal the contingency of the current work's form.

    Sophistication here means resisting hagiography and teleology alike. A naive portrait treats the author's trajectory as progressive refinement toward truth; a genealogical portrait reveals the accidents, the course corrections forced by criticism, the institutional pressures that shaped 'intellectual' choices, and the tensions between earlier commitments and current positions. It must show how the author came to forget certain origins—how debts became invisible, how contingent choices came to seem necessary—while providing enough textual evidence that the author could not simply dismiss the genealogy as misreading.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: nietzsche
    concept: genealogy_of_morals
    method: 'Nietzsche''s genealogy reveals how current meanings conceal radically
      different origins—how ''good'' once meant aristocratic power rather than altruism.
      This capability applies that suspicion to intellectual history: the current
      work''s self-presentation may naturalize what was contingent, conceal what was
      appropriated, and forget what was abandoned.'
  indicators:
  - The current work makes claims that directly contradict or abandon positions defended
    in earlier works without acknowledging the shift
  - Recurring concepts across works undergo significant semantic transformations that
    the author treats as mere 'refinements'
  - The temporal gap between prior works reveals periods of intense productivity alternating
    with silence, suggesting intellectual or institutional crises
  - Early works employ methods or vocabularies later abandoned, indicating methodological
    transformations requiring explanation
  - The author's career trajectory (positions held, institutional affiliations, audiences
    addressed) correlates with intellectual shifts in ways the work's internal logic
    doesn't acknowledge
  depth_scaling:
    surface: One to two paragraph sketch identifying origin points, major transformation
      moments, and the current work's position as continuation or rupture.
    standard: 'Multi-paragraph narrative with clear sections: origins, key transformation
      moments with textual evidence, abandonments and their likely reasons, current
      work''s self-positioning, and assessment of trajectory coherence.'
    deep: 'Full genealogical narrative analyzing: origin story with close textual
      reading, transformation moments contextualized by institutional/career factors,
      abandoned paths with hypothesized reasons grounded in evidence, current work
      as both culmination and new departure, co-evolution of ideas and methods across
      works, and meta-level assessment of whether the trajectory shows intellectual
      growth or entrenchment.'

  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability constructs detailed genealogies for each major idea, concept, or method in the current work, tracing its first appearance in the author's corpus, documenting transformations across successive works, and analyzing what it became in the present argument. Each idea genealogy combines structured data (timeline showing work, year, and form of the idea) with analytical narrative (interpretation of why and how the idea transformed). This is genealogy at the concept level: tracking herkunft (where did this idea come from?) and entstehung (under what circumstances did it take its current form?) for specific intellectual objects. The method draws on Begriffsgeschichte (conceptual history) but radicalizes it through Foucault's attention to rupture and discontinuity—concepts don't merely evolve, they undergo transformations that may radically alter their function and meaning.

    Idea genealogies provide the empirical foundation for broader genealogical claims. Where genealogical_portrait offers a narrative synthesis and author_intellectual_profile characterizes patterns, idea_genealogies grounds these in specific conceptual transformations documented with textual evidence. The capability must identify not only how ideas changed but also co-evolution patterns: did changing concept X force reconfigurations of concept Y? It must track silent abandonments—concepts prominent in early work but absent from recent work without explanation—as vigorously as explicit developments. These absences are often more revealing than continuities.

    Sophistication requires distinguishing genuine conceptual evolution from terminological drift. A concept may keep the same name while undergoing radical functional transformation (Nietzschean genealogical insight), or may change names while preserving core content (requiring detective work to track the hidden continuity). The capability must also assess whether transformations were progressive (genuine refinements solving problems in earlier formulations) or regressive (abandoning hard-won insights under external pressure). Finally, it must identify concepts the author treats as novel innovations that actually have deep roots in earlier work—places where the author has forgotten their own genealogy.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: grafton
    concept: intellectual_history_method
    method: 'Grafton''s approach to intellectual history emphasizes meticulous documentation
      of textual transmission and transformation. This capability applies that scholarly
      rigor to tracing ideas across an author''s corpus: each transformation must
      be documented with specific textual evidence, timelines must be accurate, and
      claims about conceptual change must be grounded in close reading of what the
      concept actually did in different works.'
  indicators:
  - A central concept in the current work appeared in substantially different form
    in earlier works, indicating conceptual evolution requiring documentation
  - The current work uses terminology that differs from earlier work even when discussing
    related topics, suggesting either terminological drift or genuine conceptual transformation
  - Concepts that were central to earlier arguments are conspicuously absent from
    the current work without explanation, indicating silent abandonments
  - The current work presents ideas as novel contributions that close reading reveals
    have roots in earlier work, suggesting forgotten genealogies
  - Multiple concepts in the current work seem to have evolved in tandem, suggesting
    co-evolution patterns where changes to one concept necessitated changes to others
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Identify three to five key concepts with brief notes on first appearance
      and current form, sufficient to show that genealogical work was done.
    standard: Five to eight detailed idea genealogies, each with structured timeline
      (work, year, form) and one to two paragraph evolution narrative explaining key
      transformations and their significance.
    deep: 'Comprehensive genealogies for all significant concepts: detailed timelines
      with textual evidence at each stage, multi-paragraph evolution narratives, co-evolution
      analysis showing how ideas influenced each other''s development, assessment

      of concepts the author treats as novel that actually have deep genealogical

  extended_description: |-
    This capability constructs a prosopographical portrait of the author's intellectual character as revealed through genealogical analysis. It asks not 'what does this author think?' but 'how does this author think?' and 'what patterns of intellectual practice recur across works?' Drawing on Isaiah Berlin's distinction between hedgehogs (who know one big thing) and foxes (who know many things), but refusing to reduce complexity to binary classification, this profile identifies characteristic intellectual moves, recurring argumentative strategies, persistent blind spots, and habitual ways of engaging (or evading) intellectual debts. This is prosopography applied to a single thinker: the attempt to characterize a distinctive intellectual style through pattern recognition across a body of work.

    This capability synthesizes findings from other dimensions into an assessment of intellectual character. Where genealogical_portrait traces the trajectory and idea_genealogies documents conceptual transformations, author_intellectual_profile asks what these reveal about the author as a thinker. Does the genealogy show growth—evidence of learning from criticism, abandoning unproductive paths, refining methods—or entrenchment—doubling down on contested positions, ignoring criticism, recycling arguments? How does the author handle intellectual debts: generous acknowledgment (Berlin's scholarly virtue), strategic concealment (the anxiety of influence), or genuine oversight (the limits of reflexivity)? The profile must be evidence-based, grounded in specific patterns documented by the genealogical investigation, not speculative psychology.

    Sophistication means avoiding both hagiography (treating every move as brilliant) and denunciation (treating every debt as plagiarism). The profile must be fair while being honest about weaknesses. It should compare the author to other thinkers with similar intellectual temperaments—not to diminish originality but to contextualize patterns. A naive profile lists traits; a sophisticated profile shows how intellectual strengths and weaknesses are often dialectically related—the same characteristic that enables certain insights may produce blind spots elsewhere. The profile should be specific enough that the author would recognize themselves while potentially surprised by what the pattern recognition reveals.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: berlin
    concept: intellectual_temperament
    method: 'Berlin''s approach to intellectual history emphasizes that thinkers have
      characteristic temperaments that shape what questions they find interesting,
      what answers they find plausible, and what kinds of thinking they find congenial.
      This capability applies that insight reflexively: genealogical analysis reveals
      not just what an author thought but how their intellectual character shaped
      what became thinkable for them.'
  indicators:
  - The same argumentative strategies recur across works even when addressing different
    topics, indicating characteristic intellectual moves
  - Certain types of objections or criticisms are consistently ignored or evaded across
    works, suggesting systematic blind spots
  - The pattern of citations and acknowledgments across works reveals consistent practices
    in handling intellectual debts (generous, strategic, or forgetful)
  - The genealogy reveals that the author repeatedly returns to certain core ideas
    or questions despite periodic attempts to move beyond them, indicating hedgehog
    versus fox tendencies
  - Successive works show (or fail to show) evidence of learning from criticism, revising
    failed arguments, or correcting errors, indicating intellectual growth or entrenchment
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Two to three sentences characterizing the most dominant intellectual
      habit or pattern that recurs across works.
    standard: Multi-paragraph profile covering recurring intellectual moves, characteristic
      strengths, persistent weaknesses, debt-handling patterns, and temperament classification

      profiles, and assessment of intellectual growth versus stagnation with evidence

    This capability performs reflexive epistemological assessment of the genealogical investigation itself, documenting confidence levels for specific findings, acknowledging limitations in data or method, noting where preliminary classifications (from Pass 1.5) proved inadequate, and identifying follow-up investigations that would strengthen the genealogical picture. This is genealogy practicing what it preaches: Foucault's genealogical method insists on reflexive awareness of one's own conditions of possibility, the recognition that all knowledge production operates under constraints that shape what becomes visible. A genealogical synthesis that fails to interrogate its own methodology betrays genealogy's founding insight—that truth claims must be understood in relation to their conditions of production.

    This dimension prevents the genealogical synthesis from presenting itself with false certainty. Not all findings are equally well-grounded: some claims rest on extensive textual evidence (high confidence), others on pattern recognition across limited data (medium confidence), still others on inference from absence or silence (low confidence but potentially significant). The methodology notes must be specific: which findings have what confidence levels, and why? What prior works were unavailable or only partially analyzed, creating gaps in the genealogical record? Where did the relationship classifications from Pass 1.5 prove wrong—works classified as minor influences that turned out to be foundational, or vice versa? These revisions are intellectually productive, not embarrassing admissions.

    Sophistication lies in using limitations productively rather than defensively. A naive methodology section treats limitations as mere caveats ('more research is needed'); a sophisticated reflection identifies specific follow-up investigations that would most productively extend the genealogy, explaining why those particular inquiries matter. It practices what Skinner calls the 'hermeneutics of suspicion' on itself: what biases might the analytical process introduce? Does attention to textual continuity make us blind to rupture? Does focus on acknowledged influences make us miss appropriations? The reflection should make the genealogical synthesis more usable by downstream consumers, who need to know what confidence to place in which findings.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: foucault
    concept: reflexivity
    method: 'Foucault insisted that genealogical analysis must remain aware of its
      own historical situatedness and methodological constraints. This capability

      levels, acknowledging limitations, and remaining suspicious of the genealogist''s
      own claims to comprehensive vision—recognizing that every genealogy is partial,
      situated, and shaped by its own conditions of possibility.'
  indicators:
  - Some findings rest on strong textual evidence (direct quotations, explicit citations)
    while others rest on inference from patterns or absences, requiring confidence
    differentiation
  - Certain prior works were unavailable in full text or were only partially analyzed,
    creating gaps in the genealogical record that must be acknowledged
  - Initial relationship classifications from Pass 1.5 proved inadequate as deeper
    analysis revealed different relationship types, requiring revision documentation
  - The genealogical investigation revealed areas where additional research (archival
    work, unpublished materials, interview data) would significantly strengthen findings
  - The analytical process itself may have introduced biases—for example, attention
    to continuity potentially obscuring ruptures, or focus on acknowledged influences
    missing concealed appropriations—requiring reflexive critique
