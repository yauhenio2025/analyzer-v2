# THE WHAT: Rich Intellectual Description
# ============================================================

problematique: |
  All genealogical investigation converges here. The prior passes have
  done the archaeological work: discovering prior works, classifying
  relationships, scanning for dimensional traces, and analyzing
  conditions of possibility. Now the question becomes: what does it
  all MEAN? What is the comprehensive genealogical picture of this
  work's relationship to its author's prior intellectual output?

  This engine performs the most demanding intellectual operation in
  the genealogy pipeline: SYNTHESIS. Not mere aggregation -- not a
  compilation of findings from earlier passes -- but genuine intellectual
  synthesis that reveals patterns invisible in any single pass. The
  genealogical portrait must tell a STORY: how did this author's
  thinking evolve, what intellectual currents fed into the current
  work, where did ideas originate and how were they transformed,
  what debts remain unacknowledged, and what does all of this tell
  us about the nature of intellectual production itself?

  The synthesis operates at multiple scales simultaneously. At the
  macro scale: the author's overall intellectual trajectory and the
  current work's place within it. At the meso scale: per-idea
  genealogies showing how specific concepts, methods, and arguments
  evolved across works. At the micro scale: specific textual evidence
  grounding every claim. The challenge is maintaining coherence across
  these scales -- the macro narrative must be consistent with the
  micro evidence, and the meso genealogies must connect to both.

  Foucault's genealogical method insists that we attend not only to
  what persists but to what was abandoned, not only to acknowledged
  debts but to hidden ones, not only to the logic of ideas but to
  the material and institutional conditions that shaped them.
  Nietzsche's genealogy of morals taught us that the current meaning
  of a concept often conceals a completely different origin -- that
  genealogy is the art of revealing how things came to seem natural
  that were in fact contingent. Berlin's approach to intellectual
  history reminds us that ideas have CONSEQUENCES, that intellectual
  genealogies matter because they shape what people do, not just
  what they think.

  This engine must honor all three traditions: Foucault's attention
  to discontinuity and concealment, Nietzsche's suspicion toward
  apparent naturalness, and Berlin's insistence on the practical
  stakes of intellectual history.

    description: >
      A concise 2-3 paragraph overview of the genealogical findings.
      Must be readable by someone who will read nothing else. Captures
      the most important discoveries: the dominant intellectual influences,
      the most significant evolution patterns, the key unacknowledged debts,
      and the overall character of the author's intellectual development.
    probing_questions:
      - "What are the 3-5 most important things we learned about this work's intellectual genealogy?"
      - "What would surprise the author most about these findings?"
      - "What single sentence best captures the genealogical story?"
      - "What are the practical implications -- how should a reader approach this work differently knowing its genealogy?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "One paragraph capturing the single most important genealogical finding"
      standard: "2-3 paragraphs covering dominant influences, key evolution patterns, significant unacknowledged debts, and reading implications"

  - key: genealogical_portrait
    description: >
      The detailed narrative of intellectual development. This is the
      MAIN DELIVERABLE -- a sustained analytical narrative that tells the
      story of how this work came to be what it is, tracing the author's
      intellectual trajectory from earliest relevant prior work to the
      present. Not a chronological summary but a GENEALOGICAL narrative
      that privileges descent (herkunft) and emergence (entstehung).
    probing_questions:
      - "What is the origin story -- where did the seeds of the current argument first appear?"
      - "What were the key transformation moments -- when did ideas change character?"
      - "What was abandoned along the way, and why?"
      - "How does the current work position itself relative to the trajectory -- as continuation, break, or synthesis?"
      - "What tensions in prior work does the current work resolve, and what new tensions does it create?"
      - "What is the relationship between intellectual evolution and institutional/career evolution?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "1-2 paragraph sketch of the main trajectory from earliest to current work"
      standard: "Multi-paragraph narrative covering trajectory, transformation moments, abandonments, and the current work's self-positioning, with specific textual evidence"
      deep: "Full genealogical narrative: origin story, transformation moments with close textual analysis, abandoned paths with hypothesized reasons, institutional context, the current work as both culmination and new departure, and assessment of the trajectory's coherence and productivity"

  - key: idea_genealogies
    description: >
      Per-idea genealogies: for each major idea, concept, or method in
      the current work, a timeline showing when it first appeared, how
      it was transformed in successive works, and what it became in the
      current argument. Each idea genealogy includes both a timeline
      (structured data) and an evolution narrative (analytical prose).
    probing_questions:
      - "What are the 5-10 most important ideas in the current work that have genealogical histories?"
      - "For each idea, when and where did it first appear?"
      - "How was each idea transformed across works -- what was added, dropped, reframed?"
      - "Are there ideas that the author thinks are new but actually have deep genealogical roots?"
      - "Are there ideas from prior work that were silently abandoned -- present in earlier work but absent from current work?"
      - "Do ideas evolve independently or do they co-evolve -- does changing one idea force changes to others?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Identify 3-5 key ideas with brief genealogical notes (first appearance, current form)"
      standard: "5-8 idea genealogies each with timeline (work, year, form of the idea) and 1-2 paragraph evolution narrative describing key transformations"
      deep: "Comprehensive idea genealogies for all significant concepts: detailed timelines with textual evidence at each stage, multi-paragraph evolution narratives, co-evolution analysis showing how ideas influenced each other's development, and assessment of which transformations were progressive and which were regressive"

  - key: author_intellectual_profile
    description: >
      A characterization of the author's intellectual habits, strengths,
      and weaknesses as revealed by the genealogical analysis. This is
      not biography but INTELLECTUAL PROSOPOGRAPHY of a single thinker:
      what patterns of thinking recur, what blind spots persist, what
      kinds of moves the author characteristically makes.
    probing_questions:
      - "What intellectual habits recur across works -- favorite moves, recurring strategies?"
      - "What are the author's characteristic strengths as revealed by genealogical analysis?"
      - "What blind spots or weaknesses persist across works?"
      - "How does the author handle intellectual debts -- generous acknowledgment, strategic concealment, genuine oversight?"
      - "Is the author a hedgehog (one big idea) or a fox (many ideas)? Or something more complex?"
      - "How does the author respond to criticism -- does the genealogy show course corrections?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "2-3 sentence characterization of dominant intellectual habits"
      standard: "Multi-paragraph profile covering habits, strengths, weaknesses, debt-handling patterns, and intellectual temperament, with evidence from genealogical findings"

      How the analysis was conducted, what confidence levels attach to
      which findings, what limitations were encountered, and what further
      investigation would strengthen the genealogical picture. This
      dimension practices what genealogy preaches: reflexive awareness
      of the conditions of one's own knowledge production.
    probing_questions:
      - "Which findings are high-confidence (strong textual evidence) vs. hypothetical (inferred from patterns)?"
      - "What prior works were unavailable or only partially analyzed?"
      - "Where did the classification from Pass 1.5 prove wrong or insufficient?"
      - "What would additional investigation most productively focus on?"
      - "What biases might the analytical process itself introduce?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Brief note on overall confidence level and most significant limitation"
      standard: "Structured assessment: confidence levels per major finding (high/medium/low with justification), data limitations, classification revisions from Pass 1.5, and 2-3 recommended follow-up investigations"
      deep: "Full methodological reflection: per-finding confidence with evidence quality assessment, comprehensive limitations inventory, all classification revisions with reasons, detailed follow-up research agenda, and reflexive analysis of potential biases in the genealogical method itself"

    description: >
      The 3-5 most important discoveries from the genealogical analysis.
      These are the findings that most change how a reader should understand
      the current work. Each finding should be surprising or non-obvious --
      things that would not be apparent from reading the current work alone.
    probing_questions:
      - "What discovery most changes how we should read the current work?"
      - "What is the most important unacknowledged debt?"
      - "What is the most significant abandoned idea -- something from prior work that is conspicuously absent?"
      - "What is the most interesting evolution -- an idea that changed character in unexpected ways?"
      - "What is the most important tension -- a contradiction between prior commitments and current claims?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "3 key findings, each in one sentence"
      standard: "3-5 key findings, each with a paragraph explaining the finding, its evidence, and its implications for reading the current work"
      deep: "5 key findings with extended analysis: detailed evidence, implications for multiple audiences, connection to broader patterns in the field, and assessment of how the author might respond to each finding"
