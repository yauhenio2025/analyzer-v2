# CHAIN POSITION: Engine 3 of 3 in genealogy_target_profiling chain.
# Builds on both prior engines: uses the vocabulary/methodology profile
# from conceptual_framework_extraction and the semantic field maps from
# concept_semantic_constellation to map the full inferential commitment
# structure of the work -- what you are really signing up for when you

# THE WHAT: Rich Intellectual Description
# ============================================================

problematique: |
  Ideas come in packages. Accept one claim, and you are committed to
  others -- whether you realize it or not. Endorse a particular theory
  of human nature, and you have implicitly committed to a politics, an
  ethics, and an epistemology. The inferential structure of ideas is
  the hidden wiring beneath the surface of any argument: the logical
  connections, dependencies, incompatibilities, and cascading
  implications that determine what you are REALLY signing up for
  when you nod along.

  Most readers -- and many authors -- are unaware of this wiring.
  They accept a conclusion without tracing what else it entails.
  They endorse two positions without realizing they are incompatible.
  They cite an authority without inheriting the full baggage of that
  authority's commitments. This engine makes the invisible wiring
  visible. It asks: what are the explicit commitments of this work?
  What implicit commitments follow from them? Where do commitments
  conflict? What logical dependencies create cascading chains where
  one commitment forces another, which forces another? What are the
  package deals -- bundles of ideas that can only be accepted or
  rejected as a whole?

  The philosophical foundation is Brandom's inferentialism: the
  meaning of a concept is constituted by its inferential role -- what
  it follows from, what follows from it, and what it is incompatible
  with. But the output speaks in plain language, not philosophical
  jargon. The method is Brandomian; the voice is accessible. The
  insight is that commitment structures are not academic exercises
  but practical maps: they tell you what you can and cannot say next,
  what positions are available to you, and what contradictions you
  must navigate.

  As the THIRD and final engine in the target profiling chain, this
  engine synthesizes the outputs of both prior engines into a
  commitment landscape. The vocabulary and frameworks extracted by
  conceptual_framework_extraction become the objects of commitment
  analysis. The semantic relationships mapped by concept_semantic_
  constellation reveal which commitments are semantically entangled.
  The result is the deepest layer of the target profile: not just
  what the author says (vocabulary), not just how concepts relate
  (semantic fields), but what logical structure binds it all together
  and what you are really agreeing to when you accept it.

  For genealogical analysis, the commitment structure is the
  skeleton. Vocabulary changes, metaphors evolve, framing shifts --
  but the deep inferential commitments often persist across an
  author's career, sometimes beneath the author's own awareness.
  Tracking commitment persistence and mutation across works is
  the most reliable method for detecting genuine intellectual
  continuity vs. surface-level change.

    description: >
      The claims, positions, and theses that the author explicitly
      endorses. These are the surface-level commitments -- what the
      author would acknowledge if asked "what are you arguing?"
      They form the starting points for tracing deeper structures.
    probing_questions:
      - "What are the central claims or theses the author explicitly advances?"
      - "What positions does the author take on contested questions?"
      - "What theoretical commitments are stated openly?"
      - "Which commitments are presented as the author's own vs. inherited from a tradition?"
      - "How central is each commitment -- is it load-bearing or peripheral?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "List the 3-5 most important explicit commitments with centrality assessment"
      standard: "Map all significant explicit commitments with centrality ratings, source (original vs. inherited), supporting evidence, and inter-commitment relationships"
      deep: "Complete explicit commitment inventory: every significant claim mapped with centrality, originality assessment, evidential basis, relationship to other commitments, and assessment of how the author manages the commitment (confidently, tentatively, defensively)"

  - key: implicit_commitments
    description: >
      What the author is committed to WITHOUT explicitly saying so --
      the logical consequences of their stated positions that they
      may not have noticed, may be avoiding, or may consider too
      obvious to state. These are the hidden implications that make
      inferential analysis valuable: they reveal what the author is
      REALLY arguing, not just what they think they are arguing.
    probing_questions:
      - "What follows logically from the stated positions that the author does not spell out?"
      - "Are there commitments the author seems to be avoiding -- implications they do not want to draw?"
      - "What would a careful reader be entitled to conclude that the author has not stated?"
      - "Do any implicit commitments conflict with the author's stated values or other positions?"
      - "Which implicit commitments would embarrass the author if made explicit?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Identify the 2-3 most significant unstated implications of the main arguments"
      standard: "Map implicit commitments: what follows from stated positions, how tight the inference is (locked_in/usually/loosely), whether the author seems aware, and whether the implication is welcome or awkward"
      deep: "Complete implicit commitment analysis: every significant unstated implication traced from its source commitment, inference strength assessed, author awareness evaluated, potential embarrassments noted, and assessment of whether the implicit commitments form a coherent position or reveal hidden tensions in the author's thinking"

  - key: commitment_conflicts
    description: >
      Points where the author's commitments -- explicit or implicit --
      are in tension or outright contradiction. These conflicts are
      diagnostically valuable: they reveal the fault lines in the
      author's thinking, the unresolved tensions they are managing
      (or failing to manage), and the points where the argument is
      most vulnerable to challenge.
    probing_questions:
      - "Do any explicit commitments conflict with each other?"
      - "Do implicit commitments conflict with explicit ones?"
      - "Are there commitments inherited from cited authorities that conflict with the author's own positions?"
      - "How does the author manage conflicts -- acknowledged and addressed, acknowledged and bracketed, or unacknowledged?"
      - "Are any conflicts productive (generating new insights through their tension) rather than damaging?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Note the 1-2 most significant tensions or contradictions in the argument"
      standard: "Map commitment conflicts: which commitments clash, whether the conflict is acknowledged, how the author navigates it, and whether the tension is productive or damaging"
      deep: "Full conflict analysis: every significant tension mapped with involved commitments, conflict type (direct contradiction, pragmatic tension, inherited conflict), author's navigation strategy, assessment of whether navigation succeeds, and counterfactual analysis of what the argument would look like if the conflict were resolved in each possible direction"

  - key: logical_dependencies
    description: >
      The dependency chains between commitments: which commitments
      require which others as prerequisites, which are foundational
      (nothing depends on them being justified by other commitments
      in the text), and which are terminal (many things depend on
      them but they support nothing further). Dependency chains
      reveal the load-bearing structure of an argument.
    probing_questions:
      - "Which commitments are foundational -- assumed or asserted without derivation from other commitments in this text?"
      - "Which commitments are derived -- following from earlier commitments in a chain?"
      - "What are the longest dependency chains, and where are their weakest links?"
      - "Are there circular dependencies where A supports B supports C supports A?"
      - "What is the argument's single point of failure -- the one commitment whose collapse would bring down the most?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Identify the 2-3 most important dependency chains and their foundational commitments"
      standard: "Map dependency structure: foundational commitments, derived commitments with their chains, weakest links, and single points of failure"
      deep: "Complete dependency analysis: full directed graph of commitment dependencies, chain length and strength assessment, circular dependency detection, single-point-of-failure analysis, load-bearing assessment (what collapses if each foundational commitment is removed), and comparison of the author's stated logical structure with the actual dependency structure"

  - key: hidden_implications
    description: >
      The real-world, practical, and policy implications of accepting
      the author's commitments -- the "so what?" that connects
      abstract argument to concrete consequence. Hidden implications
      are often where the argument becomes politically or ethically
      charged, even when the author presents it as purely theoretical.
    probing_questions:
      - "If the author's central claims are true, what follows for practice, policy, or action?"
      - "Are practical implications acknowledged or left unstated?"
      - "Do the implications align with or conflict with the author's apparent values?"
      - "Would the author be comfortable with all the practical implications of their position?"
      - "Are there implications that would be unwelcome to the author's own audience?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Note the 2-3 most significant practical implications of the main arguments"
      standard: "Map hidden implications: what follows for practice, whether acknowledged, whether welcome, and whether consistent with the author's stated values and audience expectations"
      deep: "Complete implication analysis: every significant practical consequence traced from its source commitments, assessment of author awareness and comfort level, audience reception analysis, comparison with implications of rival positions, and evaluation of whether the practical implications are actually embraced, reluctantly accepted, or strategically concealed"

          Do not resolve the commitment conflicts found in Pass 2 — inhabit
          them. For each significant tension between commitments, perform
          genuine dialectical work: state the thesis (the commitment in its
          strongest form), identify its internal negation (the point where
          the commitment's own logic undermines itself), and dwell in the
          collision until a higher-order understanding emerges.

          Which commitment conflicts are PRODUCTIVE — generating insight
          precisely because they cannot be resolved? The tension between a
          commitment to individual autonomy and a commitment to social
          determination, for instance, may be the engine that drives the
          entire argument forward. Collapsing it would not fix the argument
          but destroy it. Identify these generative contradictions and
          articulate what they produce that neither side could generate alone.

          Which conflicts are genuinely DESTRUCTIVE — where the author is
          committed to incompatible positions and the incompatibility is not
          productive but simply a flaw? For these, trace what a determinate
          negation would look like: not just "this fails" but "this fails in
          a way that points toward what is actually needed." Every negation
          should contain, in embryo, the specification of what would succeed.

          Pay special attention to commitment chains where accepting premise A
          forces commitment B, which contradicts commitment C, which the
          author also needs. These cascading contradictions often reveal that
          the author's real position is not any of the stated commitments but
          an unstated position that would require restructuring the entire
          commitment landscape. Articulate what that unstated position might be.

          Synthesize the full commitment landscape, now enriched by the
          dialectical pass's working-through of commitment conflicts.
          Hidden implications traced to source commitments, performative
          contradictions surfaced, citation baggage analysis revealing
          inherited commitments the author may not realize they carry,
          package deal identification with incompatibility mapping. The
          dialectical pass distinguished productive from destructive
          contradictions — integrate this into the overall commitment
          landscape synthesis. Where contradictions are productive, the
          synthesis should preserve them as generative tensions. Where
          they are destructive, the synthesis should articulate what
          restructuring of commitments the analysis points toward. The
          result is a map of what you are really signing up for — including
          which tensions come with the package and which signal genuine
          problems in the author's position.
