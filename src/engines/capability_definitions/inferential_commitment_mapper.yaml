  Ideas come in packages. Accept one claim, and you are committed to
  others -- whether you realize it or not. Endorse a particular theory
  of human nature, and you have implicitly committed to a politics, an
  ethics, and an epistemology. The inferential structure of ideas is
  the hidden wiring beneath the surface of any argument: the logical
  connections, dependencies, incompatibilities, and cascading
  implications that determine what you are REALLY signing up for
  when you nod along.

  Most readers -- and many authors -- are unaware of this wiring.
  They accept a conclusion without tracing what else it entails.
  They endorse two positions without realizing they are incompatible.
  They cite an authority without inheriting the full baggage of that
  authority's commitments. This engine makes the invisible wiring
  visible. It asks: what are the explicit commitments of this work?
  What implicit commitments follow from them? Where do commitments
  conflict? What logical dependencies create cascading chains where
  one commitment forces another, which forces another? What are the
  package deals -- bundles of ideas that can only be accepted or
  rejected as a whole?

  The philosophical foundation is Brandom's inferentialism: the
  meaning of a concept is constituted by its inferential role -- what
  it follows from, what follows from it, and what it is incompatible
  with. But the output speaks in plain language, not philosophical
  jargon. The method is Brandomian; the voice is accessible. The
  insight is that commitment structures are not academic exercises
  but practical maps: they tell you what you can and cannot say next,
  what positions are available to you, and what contradictions you
  must navigate.

  As the THIRD and final engine in the target profiling chain, this
  engine synthesizes the outputs of both prior engines into a
  commitment landscape. The vocabulary and frameworks extracted by
  conceptual_framework_extraction become the objects of commitment
  analysis. The semantic relationships mapped by concept_semantic_
  constellation reveal which commitments are semantically entangled.
  The result is the deepest layer of the target profile: not just
  what the author says (vocabulary), not just how concepts relate
  (semantic fields), but what logical structure binds it all together
  and what you are really agreeing to when you accept it.

  For genealogical analysis, the commitment structure is the
  skeleton. Vocabulary changes, metaphors evolve, framing shifts --
  but the deep inferential commitments often persist across an
  author's career, sometimes beneath the author's own awareness.
  Tracking commitment persistence and mutation across works is
  the most reliable method for detecting genuine intellectual
  continuity vs. surface-level change.

intellectual_lineage:
  primary:
    name: brandom
    description: Robert Brandom (1950–), American philosopher whose inferentialist semantics grounds meaning
      in patterns of commitment and entitlement rather than representation or reference. His articulation
      of concepts as nodes in inferential networks—defined by what follows from them, what they follow
      from, and what they're incompatible with—provides this engine's foundational architecture for mapping
      the logical structure beneath any system of claims. Brandom's deontic scorekeeping model, which
      treats discourse as a game of tracking who is committed and entitled to what, becomes the engine's
      method for revealing hidden commitments authors inherit when endorsing positions.
  secondary:
  - name: sellars
    description: Wilfrid Sellars (1912–1989), whose distinction between the 'space of reasons' (where
      commitments are justified through inference) and the 'space of causes' (where events have causal
      explanations) anchors this engine's focus on logical rather than merely causal relationships between
      ideas. His critique of the 'Myth of the Given'—the idea that beliefs can be justified non-inferentially—reinforces
      the engine's assumption that all commitments exist within networks of mutual support and constraint.
      Sellars provides the metaphor of inferential space as a distinct ontological domain where this engine
      operates.
  - name: frege
    description: Gottlob Frege (1848–1925), founder of modern logic whose distinction between sense and
      reference, and whose systematic treatment of logical consequence, established the formal vocabulary
      for analyzing inferential relationships. His context principle—that words have meaning only in the
      context of sentences, sentences only in the context of inferences—anticipates Brandom's inferentialism
      and justifies this engine's holistic approach to commitment structures. Frege's logical rigor provides
      the standard of precision this engine aspires to when mapping entailment and incompatibility relations.
  - name: toulmin
    description: Stephen Toulmin (1922–2009), whose The Uses of Argument (1958) shifted focus from formal
      validity to the material warrants that actually govern reasoning in practice—law, ethics, science—across
      different domains. His model of argumentation (claim, warrant, backing, rebuttal) provides this
      engine with a practical schema for analyzing how commitments are justified in real texts, not just
      idealized logic. Toulmin's emphasis on field-dependent inferential norms allows the engine to recognize
      that commitment structures vary by discourse context while remaining systematically analyzable.
  traditions:
  - name: inferentialism
    description: 'The semantic tradition holding that the meaning of any expression is constituted entirely
      by its inferential role—what follows from it, what it follows from, and what it excludes. Inferentialism
      rejects representationalist and referentialist semantics in favor of treating concepts as positions
      in a network of reasoning practices. For this engine, inferentialism is the core methodology: to
      understand what an author means by a term, map its inferential commitments; to evaluate a position,
      trace what it entails and what it rules out.'
  - name: space_of_reasons
    description: The conceptual domain, articulated by Sellars and developed by Brandom, in which claims
      stand in rational relations of justification, entitlement, and incompatibility rather than merely
      causal relations. Entering the space of reasons means becoming subject to norms of inference and
      assessment. This engine operates entirely within this space, treating texts as moves in the game
      of giving and asking for reasons, and commitment structures as the underlying rule-systems that
      govern legitimate moves.
  - name: logical_analysis
    description: The philosophical method, dominant in analytic philosophy since Frege and Russell, of
      clarifying concepts and arguments by exposing their logical form—making explicit the entailment
      relations, valid inference patterns, and formal structures implicit in ordinary language. This engine
      inherits logical analysis's commitment to rigor and systematicity, but applies it to material inferential
      content rather than merely formal validity. The goal is to make the logical skeleton of commitments
      visible without reducing meaning to symbolic manipulation.
  - name: argumentation_theory
    description: The interdisciplinary study of reasoning-in-practice, encompassing rhetoric, informal
      logic, dialectics, and the analysis of actual arguments in law, science, politics, and everyday
      discourse. Argumentation theory provides this engine with sensitivity to context-dependent inferential
      norms and real-world commitment structures that pure formal logic misses. Where formal logic asks
      'Is this valid?', argumentation theory asks 'What commitments does this speaker undertake by making
      this move?'—precisely the question driving this engine.
  - name: deontic_scorekeeping
    description: 'Brandom''s model of discourse as a social practice of tracking normative statuses—who
      is committed to what, who is entitled to what claims, whose commitments have been discharged or
      inherited. The scorekeeping metaphor treats assertions as moves that alter deontic scores: making
      a claim undertakes commitment, challenges demand entitlement, concessions transfer commitments.
      This engine applies deontic scorekeeping logic to texts, treating authors as players whose positions
      generate score-states that can be tracked, compared, and evaluated for consistency and consequence.'
  key_concepts:
  - name: inferential_commitment
    definition: What you are obligated to defend or accept by virtue of asserting a claim; the downstream
      consequences and upstream prerequisites that come as a package with any position. The engine maps
      these commitments to reveal what an author has signed up for beyond their explicit statements—what
      must be true if their claims are true, what they must reject if they reject certain conclusions.
  - name: material_inference
    definition: An inference whose validity depends on the content of concepts involved rather than formal
      logical structure alone (e.g., 'X is red' entails 'X is colored'). The engine tracks material inferences
      because most real reasoning operates through content-rich connections that formal logic alone cannot
      capture, making material inferential networks the actual wiring of intellectual commitments.
  - name: incompatibility
    definition: A relation between claims where accepting one rationally forbids accepting the other,
      creating constraint within commitment space. The engine uses incompatibility detection to identify
      contradictions, tensions, and impossible combinations—revealing where authors attempt to hold positions
      that cannot coherently coexist, or where competing schools of thought diverge at the level of basic
      commitments.
  - name: entitlement
    definition: The normative status of being justified in making a claim or drawing an inference; having
      met the conditions—evidential, inferential, authoritative—that license the assertion. The engine
      distinguishes between commitments undertaken (what the author claims) and entitlements earned (what
      the author has justified), exposing gaps where positions are asserted but not warranted by the inferential
      structure provided.
  - name: deontic_score
    definition: The total configuration of commitments and entitlements attributed to a speaker at any
      point in discourse; the normative status-profile that determines what moves are available or required
      next. The engine constructs deontic scores for texts to represent their complete commitment landscape,
      enabling comparison across works, detection of shifts, and assessment of internal consistency.
  - name: package_deal
    definition: A cluster of commitments so tightly inferentially bound that accepting any one element
      rationally requires accepting all others; positions that cannot be unbundled without incoherence.
      The engine identifies package deals to show readers what seemingly separable claims actually come
      as mandatory bundles—revealing the hidden scope of what endorsing a theory commits you to.
  - name: commitment_chain
    definition: A sequence of inferential steps where each commitment forces the next in cascading fashion,
      such that accepting the initial premise rationally compels accepting the final conclusion through
      intermediate steps. The engine traces commitment chains to make explicit the full downstream consequences
      of initial assumptions, showing how accepting apparently modest premises can lock you into far-reaching
      positions.
  - name: performative_contradiction
    definition: A special case of incoherence where the act of asserting a claim undermines or contradicts
      the content asserted (e.g., 'I am not speaking'). The engine detects performative contradictions
      as particularly damaging commitment failures where authors' discursive practices betray incompatibility
      with their explicit positions—revealing tensions between what is said and what is done in the saying.

    What the author is committed to WITHOUT explicitly saying so -- the logical consequences of their stated positions that they may not have noticed, may be avoiding, or may consider too obvious to state. These are the hidden implications that make inferential analysis valuable: they reveal what the author is REALLY arguing, not just what they think they are arguing.

    Points where the author's commitments -- explicit or implicit -- are in tension or outright contradiction. These conflicts are diagnostically valuable: they reveal the fault lines in the author's thinking, the unresolved tensions they are managing (or failing to manage), and the points where the argument is most vulnerable to challenge.

  description: |
    The dependency chains between commitments: which commitments require which others as prerequisites, which are foundational (nothing depends on them being justified by other commitments in the text), and which are terminal (many things depend on them but they support nothing further). Dependency chains reveal the load-bearing structure of an argument.

    in this text?

- key: hidden_implications
  description: |
    The real-world, practical, and policy implications of accepting the author's commitments -- the "so what?" that connects abstract argument to concrete consequence. Hidden implications are often where the argument becomes politically or ethically charged, even when the author presents it as purely theoretical.

  produces_dimensions:
  - explicit_commitments
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability constructs an inventory of every claim, position, and thesis that the author openly endorses—the commitments they would acknowledge owning if directly asked. In Brandom's inferentialist framework, these explicit commitments are the author's public deontic score: the positions they have staked out in the space of reasons, the claims for which they accept responsibility and which thereby entitle them to certain further moves while prohibiting others. Mapping explicit commitments means identifying not just what is said, but what is *undertaken* as a commitment—distinguishing genuine endorsements from mere reportings, explorations, or attributions to others. It requires assessing the centrality of each commitment (is it load-bearing or peripheral?), its originality (is it the author's own or inherited from a tradition?), and the manner of its holding (confident assertion, tentative exploration, defensive qualification).

    This capability forms the foundation for all subsequent inferential analysis. Without a reliable map of what the author explicitly commits to, there is no baseline from which to trace implicit commitments, detect conflicts, or map dependencies. It transforms the raw textual surface into a structured commitment space that other capabilities can operate on. The explicit commitments become nodes in a network; everything else maps their relations.

    The non-trivial aspect is distinguishing genuine commitments from neighboring speech acts. Authors report others' views, entertain hypotheticals, acknowledge objections, and gesture toward positions without fully endorsing them. A naive reading treats every declarative sentence as a commitment; sophisticated analysis tracks the performative force of each claim—does this passage undertake a commitment or merely acknowledge one? Does the author own this position or simply cite it? The mapping must capture not just what is said but what is staked.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: brandom
    concept: deontic_scorekeeping
    method: Brandom's notion that discursive practice involves keeping score on who is committed to what
      allows us to treat explicit commitments as the author's public deontic score—the set of positions
      they are on the hook for defending, which determines what further moves are available to them in
      the space of reasons.
  indicators:
  - Thesis statements or explicit declarations of position ("I argue that...", "My claim is...")
  - Sustained defense of a particular position across multiple passages or chapters
  - Explicit rejection of rival positions, marking boundaries of commitment
  - Passages where the author takes responsibility for a claim's justification rather than attributing
    it to others
  - Statements presented as foundational or axiomatic within the work's argumentative structure

    to without saying so
  produces_dimensions:
  - implicit_commitments
  requires_dimensions:
  - explicit_commitments
  extended_description: |-
    This capability traces the logical consequences that follow from explicit commitments but remain unstated—the positions an author is bound to by virtue of what they have explicitly endorsed, whether or not they recognize or acknowledge this binding. In Brandom's inferentialism, the content of a concept is constituted by its inferential role: what it commits you to saying, what it entitles you to infer, what it is incompatible with. Implicit commitments are the downstream nodes in these inferential chains—the claims that become part of your deontic score not by explicit undertaking but by material consequence. This capability performs inferential projection: given these explicit commitments, what else must be true? What positions become unavailable? What claims would the author need to deny to remain consistent? It identifies both tightly-bound implications (logical or conceptual necessities) and looser practical entailments that follow defeasibly but standardly.

    This capability is crucial because it reveals the gap between what authors think they are arguing and what they are actually committed to. Authors may endorse a seemingly narrow claim without recognizing that it entails a much broader theoretical or political position. They may selectively emphasize certain implications while leaving embarrassing ones unstated. Surfacing implicit commitments makes the full inferential structure visible, allowing genealogical analysis to track not just what is said across a career but what is logically bound to what has been said. It also enables critical engagement: to challenge an argument effectively often means showing that its implicit commitments are unacceptable, even when its explicit commitments seem reasonable.

    The sophistication lies in distinguishing strength of inference. Some implicit commitments are locked-in: deny them and you generate a contradiction. Others follow standardly but defeasibly: they are the normal inference absent special circumstances. Still others are loose associations that follow only given additional auxiliary assumptions. A naive analysis treats all implications as equally bound; careful work assesses the tightness of each inferential connection and whether the author shows awareness of the commitment.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: brandom
    concept: material_inference
    method: Brandom's account of material inference—inference that is good by virtue of the conceptual
      contents involved, not formal logical structure alone—grounds the analysis of implicit commitments
      as what follows from explicit positions by the material inferential roles of the concepts deployed,
      tracing consequences that may not be formally valid but are conceptually binding.
  indicators:
  - Explicit commitments that invoke concepts with rich inferential roles (e.g., committing to 'autonomy'
    implicitly commits to certain views about constraint and freedom)
  - Theoretical positions that historically or conceptually entail further positions the author does not
    mention
  - Asymmetries where the author draws certain implications but not others that follow by parallel reasoning
  - Frameworks or methods that carry standard commitments the author has not explicitly endorsed
  - Passages where the author's argument would be stronger if certain unstated implications were made
    explicit, suggesting they may be unaware of them

  extended_description: |-
    This capability identifies points where commitments—explicit or implicit, original or inherited—stand in tension or outright contradiction with one another. In inferentialist terms, it detects incompatibility relations: positions that cannot both be endorsed without generating inconsistency or pragmatic incoherence. Conflict detection operates at multiple levels: explicit commitments may directly contradict each other; explicit commitments may be undercut by their own implicit consequences; commitments inherited from cited authorities may clash with the author's original positions; methodological commitments may conflict with substantive claims. The capability must distinguish genuine logical contradictions from productive tensions that generate dialectical movement, and must assess whether conflicts are acknowledged by the author (and if so, how they are managed), bracketed and left unresolved, or simply invisible to the author's own self-understanding.

    Conflict detection is diagnostically crucial because it reveals the fault lines in an argument—the points of maximum vulnerability and the sites where the author's thinking is under the greatest strain. For genealogical work, tracking how an author navigates commitment conflicts across texts reveals their evolving priorities: which commitments get preserved when conflicts force a choice, which get modified, which get quietly abandoned. Conflicts also mark points where external critique has the most purchase: showing that an argument is internally conflicted is often more devastating than attacking it from an external position.

    The sophistication lies in recognizing that not all conflicts are problems. Some tensions are generative—the productive contradiction that drives dialectical development rather than mere inconsistency. A naive reading flags every apparent inconsistency as a flaw; sophisticated analysis distinguishes between conflicts that undermine the position, conflicts that the author successfully navigates through qualification or dialectical integration, and conflicts that remain unresolved but do not collapse the entire structure. It also recognizes performative contradictions where the act of making an argument contradicts its content.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: brandom
    concept: incompatibility
    method: Brandom's analysis of incompatibility as a primitive inferential relation—understanding negation
      and contradiction not through formal logic but through the material exclusions between commitments—allows
      us to detect conflicts not only as formal contradictions but as substantive incompatibilities where
      holding both positions requires giving up claims that partially constitute their content.
  indicators:
  - Explicit statements that appear to contradict earlier or later claims in the same work
  - Implicit consequences of one commitment that negate another commitment
  - Methodological commitments (e.g., empiricism) that conflict with substantive claims (e.g., metaphysical
    postulates)
  - Inherited positions from cited authorities that the author endorses despite having criticized similar
    positions elsewhere
  - Rhetorical tension where the argumentative force moves in a different direction from the explicit
    conclusion
  - Defensive or qualifying language clustering around certain claims, suggesting the author senses but
    has not resolved a tension

  - explicit_commitments
  - implicit_commitments
  extended_description: |-
    This capability maps the directed dependency graph between commitments—the logical and evidential support relations that determine which commitments rest on which others. In any complex argument, commitments form a hierarchical structure: some are foundational (taken as starting points, assumed without derivation from other commitments in the text), others are intermediate (derived from foundational commitments but themselves supporting further claims), and still others are terminal (derived but not themselves used to derive anything further). Dependency tracing constructs the full directed graph: for each commitment, what does it depend on, and what depends on it? It identifies dependency chains (sequences where A supports B supports C), assesses their length and strength, locates weak links (points where the inferential connection is questionable), and performs load-bearing analysis (what would collapse if a given foundational commitment were removed?). It also detects circular dependencies where commitment structures loop back on themselves—potentially vicious circles or potentially coherentist structures where mutual support is legitimate.

    This capability is essential because it reveals the actual logical architecture of an argument, which often differs from the author's presentation. Authors may present commitment X as foundational when it actually depends on hidden assumption Y; they may treat commitment Z as a minor corollary when it is in fact doing significant load-bearing work for other parts of the argument. Dependency analysis exposes single points of failure—the one commitment whose collapse would bring down the most—and thereby identifies where an argument is most vulnerable. For genealogical analysis, tracking which commitments are treated as foundational across an author's career reveals their deepest intellectual anchors, the positions they are most reluctant to give up.

    The non-trivial aspect is distinguishing among types of dependency. Some are deductive: B follows necessarily from A. Others are evidential: A provides support for B but does not entail it. Still others are pragmatic: B requires A as a presupposition for its intelligibility. A sophisticated analysis tracks dependency type and strength for each link, recognizes that some apparent dependencies are not genuine (the argument could be restructured to avoid them), and identifies hidden dependencies that the author has not made explicit but which are doing implicit work.
  intellectual_grounding:

    concept: warrant_and_backing
    method: Toulmin's analysis of argument structure as involving not just claims and data but warrants
      (inferential licenses connecting them) and backing (justification for the warrants) provides the
      framework for tracing dependency chains, distinguishing between what commitments explicitly support
      others (warrants) and what deeper commitments justify those inferential moves (backing).
  indicators:
  - Explicitly signaled inferential moves ("therefore", "it follows that", "this implies")
  - Arguments structured with premises and conclusions where some claims are justified by appeal to others
  - Foundational claims introduced without justification or marked as axioms, assumptions, or starting
    points
  - Lengthy chains of reasoning where a conclusion at step N depends on all prior steps
  - Passages where the author's justification for a claim points back to an earlier commitment
  - Claims that appear repeatedly as premises for multiple conclusions, suggesting high load-bearing centrality

  extended_description: |-
    This capability traces the practical, policy, and real-world consequences that follow from accepting the author's theoretical commitments—the "so what?" that connects abstract argument to concrete action or institutional design. In the space of reasons, commitments are not inert propositions but inference-licenses and prohibition-generators: they determine what you can appropriately say or do next. Hidden implications are the downstream consequences for practice that the author may not explicitly draw, may not have considered, or may be strategically avoiding. They answer: if we accept this theory of human nature, what follows for how we should structure schools? If we endorse this epistemology, what follows for scientific practice or legal standards of evidence? If we adopt this ethical framework, what becomes permissible or forbidden? The capability must assess not just what implications follow but whether the author acknowledges them, whether they align with the author's stated values, and whether they would be welcome or embarrassing to the author or their intended audience.

    This capability bridges the gap between theoretical and practical discourse, revealing that seemingly abstract philosophical commitments often have concrete political, ethical, or institutional consequences. For genealogical analysis, hidden implications show how intellectual positions connect to structures of power, patterns of exclusion, or political projects—sometimes consciously, sometimes not. An author may present a position as purely descriptive or theoretical while it carries normative implications that would be controversial if made explicit. Tracing implications also enables critical assessment: a position may seem attractive in the abstract but reveal problematic consequences when its implications are drawn out.

    The non-trivial work is distinguishing which implications genuinely follow from which commitments, with what degree of necessity, and under what background assumptions. Some implications are tightly bound: accept this metaphysical position and you must accept these ethical constraints. Others are contingent: the implication follows only given current institutional arrangements or additional normative commitments the author has not explicitly made. A naive analysis simply free-associates practical concerns with theoretical positions; sophisticated analysis traces precise inferential paths from commitment to implication, assesses the strength of each connection, and evaluates whether implications that seem to follow can actually be blocked by plausible auxiliary commitments.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: sellars
    concept: space_of_reasons_vs_space_of_causes
    method: Sellars' distinction between the space of reasons (the realm of justification and inferential
      relations) and the space of causes (the realm of natural-scientific explanation) grounds the analysis
      of hidden implications by showing how commitments within the space of reasons have practical force—they
      constrain what one can consistently do or endorse—thereby bridging normative theoretical commitments
      to concrete practical consequences.
  indicators:
  - Theoretical commitments with obvious policy or institutional implications that the author does not
    discuss
  - Normative or evaluative vocabulary embedded in supposedly descriptive claims, suggesting practical
    stakes
  - Argumentative contexts with high political or ethical stakes where practical implications would be
    sensitive
  - Explicit claims about one domain (e.g., epistemology) with clear but unstated implications for another
    domain (e.g., education policy)
  - Defensive framing or qualification around certain commitments, suggesting awareness of unwelcome implications
  - Rival positions that the author criticizes specifically for their practical consequences, implying
    that practical implications matter to the debate

      commitments with precise inferential paths, assessment of author awareness and comfort level, analysis
      of strategic framing choices, comparison with implications of rival positions, evaluation of whether
      the author's practical commitments are consistent with their theoretical ones, and counterfactual
      analysis of what embracing vs. rejecting the implications would mean for the author's overall project.

      Do not resolve the commitment conflicts found in Pass 2 — inhabit
      them. For each significant tension between commitments, perform
      genuine dialectical work: state the thesis (the commitment in its
      strongest form), identify its internal negation (the point where
      the commitment's own logic undermines itself), and dwell in the
      collision until a higher-order understanding emerges.

      Which commitment conflicts are PRODUCTIVE — generating insight
      precisely because they cannot be resolved? The tension between a
      commitment to individual autonomy and a commitment to social
      determination, for instance, may be the engine that drives the
      entire argument forward. Collapsing it would not fix the argument
      but destroy it. Identify these generative contradictions and
      articulate what they produce that neither side could generate alone.

      Which conflicts are genuinely DESTRUCTIVE — where the author is
      committed to incompatible positions and the incompatibility is not
      productive but simply a flaw? For these, trace what a determinate
      negation would look like: not just "this fails" but "this fails in
      a way that points toward what is actually needed." Every negation
      should contain, in embryo, the specification of what would succeed.

      Pay special attention to commitment chains where accepting premise A
      forces commitment B, which contradicts commitment C, which the
      author also needs. These cascading contradictions often reveal that
      the author's real position is not any of the stated commitments but
      an unstated position that would require restructuring the entire
      commitment landscape. Articulate what that unstated position might be.

      Synthesize the full commitment landscape, now enriched by the
      dialectical pass's working-through of commitment conflicts.
      Hidden implications traced to source commitments, performative
      contradictions surfaced, citation baggage analysis revealing
      inherited commitments the author may not realize they carry,
      package deal identification with incompatibility mapping. The
      dialectical pass distinguished productive from destructive
      contradictions — integrate this into the overall commitment
      landscape synthesis. Where contradictions are productive, the
      synthesis should preserve them as generative tensions. Where
      they are destructive, the synthesis should articulate what
      restructuring of commitments the analysis points toward. The
      result is a map of what you are really signing up for — including
      which tensions come with the package and which signal genuine
      problems in the author's position.
