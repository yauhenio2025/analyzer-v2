problematique: |-
  Ideas do not simply coexist — they clash, transform, and generate new ideas through their very opposition. Every significant intellectual work contains tensions it cannot fully resolve, contradictions it may not even recognize, and dependencies on the very positions it claims to oppose. The dialectical structure of thought is this hidden engine of intellectual development: the way thesis and antithesis collide, the way each position secretly requires its enemy, the way attempted resolutions preserve some elements while destroying others. To read without grasping dialectical structure is to see only the surface of argument — the positions stated — while missing the dynamic forces that generate, sustain, and ultimately transform those positions.

  Most readers treat contradictions as failures of logic to be corrected. Most authors try to hide or minimize the tensions in their work. But the dialectical tradition reveals that contradiction is not a bug but a feature — the motor of thought itself. The interesting question is never 'is there a contradiction?' (there always is) but rather 'what kind of contradiction is it, and what does it generate?' Some contradictions are merely apparent and dissolve under analysis. Others are genuine but resolvable through synthesis. Still others are constitutive — the very conditions that make the discourse possible, unresolvable without destroying the framework itself. This engine maps these different species of contradiction and traces their effects.

  The philosophical foundation runs from Hegel through Marx to the Frankfurt School and contemporary critical theory. Hegel's insight was that contradiction is not the end of thought but its beginning — that the negative is productive, that determinate negation yields something new. Marx materialized this insight, showing how contradictions in economic and social structures drive historical transformation. Adorno's negative dialectics warned against premature synthesis, insisting that some contradictions must be held open, that the 'non-identical' resists absorption into any conceptual totality. Derrida's deconstruction revealed how binary oppositions harbor undecidability at their core. This engine operationalizes these traditions without requiring the reader to know them.

  Within the logic suite, the Dialectical Structure Mapper occupies a unique position: where argument_architecture maps the static structure of reasoning and inferential_commitment_mapper traces logical entailments, this engine reveals the dynamic tensions that drive discourse forward or hold it in place. It shows not just what positions exist but why they exist in opposition, how they secretly depend on each other, and what would happen if their contradictions were resolved or intensified. It synthesizes with counterfactual_analyzer (what would change if this tension resolved differently?) and theory_construction_analyzer (how do contradictions constrain theory-building?).

  Commitment to dialectical analysis matters because intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that your position depends on what it opposes. Every claim gains its meaning partly through what it excludes. Every synthesis leaves something behind. The thinker who cannot see the tensions driving their own discourse is controlled by those tensions rather than navigating them deliberately. Dialectical mapping is not a technique for winning arguments but a discipline for understanding how arguments actually work — including, especially, one's own.
researcher_question: What contradictions drive this discourse, and how do they work
  themselves out?
intellectual_lineage:
  primary:
    name: hegel
    description: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), German idealist philosopher
      who developed the most systematic account of dialectical logic in Western philosophy.
      His insight that contradiction is not mere error but the engine of conceptual
      development — that thought progresses through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis
      (Aufhebung) — provides this engine's foundational architecture. Hegel's concept
      of 'determinate negation' — that negating something specific yields something
      specific rather than nothing — grounds the engine's tracking of what gets preserved
      and destroyed in dialectical movement. His analysis of how apparent opposites
      (being/nothing, master/slave, universal/particular) secretly depend on and generate
      each other provides the model for mapping tensions in any discourse.
  secondary:
  - name: marx
    description: Karl Marx (1818–1883), who materialized Hegelian dialectics by grounding
      contradictions in concrete social and economic relations rather than pure thought.
      His method of revealing how ideological positions serve particular class interests
      while claiming universality, and how contradictions in the economic base generate
      contradictions in the ideological superstructure, provides this engine's sensitivity
      to the material stakes beneath conceptual conflicts. Marx's analysis of commodity
      fetishism — how social relations appear as relations between things — models
      how this engine detects hidden dependencies and inversions.
  - name: adorno
    description: Theodor W. Adorno (1903–1969), Frankfurt School philosopher whose
      'negative dialectics' resisted the Hegelian drive toward synthesis and reconciliation.
      Adorno insisted that some contradictions must be held open, that the 'non-identical'
      — aspects of reality that resist conceptual absorption — must be preserved against
      totalizing thought. This engine's detection of 'non-identical remainders' and
      its skepticism toward premature synthesis derive directly from Adorno's critical
      project. His analysis of how identity thinking does violence to particularity
      informs the engine's tracking of what gets excluded or destroyed in dialectical
      resolution.
  - name: derrida
    description: Jacques Derrida (1930–2004), whose deconstructive practice revealed
      how binary oppositions harbor undecidability at their core — how the privileged
      term secretly depends on the excluded term it claims to dominate. Derrida's
      concepts of the 'supplement' (what is supposedly added but proves essential),
      'différance' (meaning's endless deferral), and the 'constitutive outside' (what
      must be excluded for a system to function) provide this engine's tools for analyzing
      binary structures and their instabilities. His method of reading texts against
      themselves — finding where they say more or other than they intend — informs
      the engine's approach to immanent critique.
  - name: jameson
    description: Fredric Jameson (1934–2024), Marxist literary critic whose method
      of 'metacommentary' revealed how texts unconsciously work through the social
      contradictions of their historical moment. Jameson's insistence that interpretation
      must reconstruct the 'political unconscious' — the absent cause that structures
      a text without appearing directly within it — provides this engine's sensitivity
      to tensions that discourse cannot acknowledge without dissolving itself. His
      concept of the 'strategy of containment' — how texts manage contradictions they
      cannot resolve — informs the engine's analysis of attempted syntheses.
  - name: butler
    description: Judith Butler (1956–), whose work on performativity and subject formation
      revealed how identities are constituted through repeated exclusions and how
      the excluded always returns to destabilize the constituted. Butler's analysis
      of how binary categories (male/female, nature/culture) are not natural givens
      but performatively produced and inherently unstable provides this engine's approach
      to mapping binaries and their vulnerabilities. Her concept of 'constitutive
      exclusion' — what must be cast out for an identity to cohere — grounds the engine's
      detection of what cannot be thought within a discourse.
  traditions:
  - name: german_idealism
    description: The philosophical tradition running from Kant through Fichte and
      Schelling to Hegel, which developed the systematic analysis of how thought relates
      to itself and generates new content through its own activity. German Idealism's
      core insight — that the subject is not a passive receiver but actively constitutes
      its objects, and that this constitution involves necessary tensions — provides
      the philosophical ground for treating contradictions as productive rather than
      merely erroneous.
  - name: western_marxism
    description: The tradition of Marxist thought from Lukács through Gramsci to the
      Frankfurt School that emphasized ideology critique and cultural analysis over
      economistic determinism. Western Marxism's focus on reification (how dynamic
      social relations come to appear as static things), hegemony (how domination
      works through consent rather than force), and the dialectic of enlightenment
      (how progress contains regression) informs this engine's sensitivity to hidden
      dependencies and inversions in discourse.
  - name: frankfurt_school
    description: The critical theory tradition associated with the Institute for Social
      Research, including Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, and later Habermas. The Frankfurt
      School's method of 'immanent critique' — criticizing society by its own stated
      standards — provides this engine's most powerful analytical tool. Their analysis
      of how enlightenment rationality dialectically produces new forms of domination,
      and their insistence on preserving the utopian moment even in critique, shapes
      the engine's approach to evaluating syntheses.
  - name: deconstruction
    description: The philosophical practice associated with Derrida and his followers
      that reveals how texts undermine their own apparent meanings through the play
      of language and the instability of binary oppositions. Deconstruction's method
      of identifying 'aporias' (irresolvable contradictions) and tracing how texts
      deconstruct themselves provides this engine's tools for detecting deconstructive
      moments — points where the text's argument turns against itself or where meaning
      resists fixation.
  - name: hegelian_marxism
    description: The strand of Marxist thought that emphasizes Hegel's dialectical
      method rather than scientific materialism, including Lukács, Korsch, and the
      early Frankfurt School. Hegelian Marxism's insistence that totality must be
      grasped dialectically — that parts can only be understood through their relation
      to the whole, and the whole through its parts — provides this engine's approach
      to hermeneutic circles and the critique of partial perspectives claiming to
      be complete.
  - name: negative_theology
    description: The mystical tradition of defining the divine through what it is
      not, practiced by Pseudo-Dionysius, Meister Eckhart, and others. While not directly
      political, negative theology's method of approaching truth through negation
      rather than positive assertion — and its recognition that the most important
      realities exceed conceptual capture — resonates with Adorno's negative dialectics
      and informs this engine's attention to what resists synthesis and what cannot
      be said within a discourse.
  key_concepts:
  - name: aufhebung
    definition: Hegel's untranslatable term (variously rendered as sublation, supersession,
      or overcoming) for the dialectical operation that simultaneously negates, preserves,
      and elevates. When a contradiction is aufgehoben, something is destroyed (the
      immediate opposition), something is preserved (valid elements of both sides),
      and something new emerges at a higher level. This engine tracks all three movements
      in any attempted synthesis.
  - name: determinate_negation
    definition: 'Hegel''s insight that negating something specific yields something
      specific rather than mere emptiness. When we negate ''being'' we get not nothing
      but ''nothing'' as a determinate concept that itself generates new content.
      Determinate negation is the motor of dialectical progress: each negation produces
      positive content. This engine traces what specific content emerges from each
      negation in a discourse.'
  - name: non_identical
    definition: 'Adorno''s term for that which resists absorption into conceptual
      frameworks — the particular that exceeds the universal, the remainder that escapes
      categorization. The non-identical is what identity thinking necessarily does
      violence to. This engine detects non-identical remainders: aspects of the subject
      matter that the discourse''s concepts cannot adequately capture and that persistently
      trouble its syntheses.'
  - name: constitutive_outside
    definition: The position or element that must be excluded for a discourse to constitute
      itself, yet which secretly enables that constitution. The constitutive outside
      is not merely absent but actively produced as absent — it is what the discourse
      cannot think without ceasing to be itself. This engine identifies what each
      discourse must exclude to function and traces how this exclusion haunts the
      discourse.
  - name: immanent_critique
    definition: The method of criticizing a position using its own stated standards
      rather than imposing external criteria. Immanent critique is the most devastating
      form of criticism because it shows that a position fails by its own lights.
      This engine systematically applies immanent critique by identifying a discourse's
      explicit commitments and locating where it violates them.
  - name: master_slave_dialectic
    definition: Hegel's famous analysis of how the dominant party in a relationship
      comes to depend on the subordinate party for recognition and how this creates
      the conditions for reversal. The master needs the slave's recognition to be
      a master; the slave, through labor, develops capacities the master lacks. This
      engine detects analogous dependencies wherever one position claims dominance
      over another.
  - name: totality
    definition: The whole considered as more than the sum of its parts — a system
      of interconnected elements that can only be understood through their relations.
      Dialectical thinking insists on grasping totality while remaining critical of
      any particular claim to represent the whole. This engine identifies claims to
      totality, examines what they exclude, and assesses whether they genuinely integrate
      or merely aggregate their elements.
  - name: reification
    definition: 'Lukács''s development of Marx''s commodity fetishism: the process
      by which social relations come to appear as natural things, dynamic processes
      as static givens, historical products as eternal facts. Reification is ideology''s
      preferred mode of operation. This engine detects reification by identifying
      where discourses naturalize what is in fact socially constructed or present
      contingent arrangements as necessary.'
analytical_dimensions:
- key: tension_structure
  description: The architecture of contradictions and conflicts within and across
    texts, mapped according to their depth, acknowledgment, and generative effects.
    This dimension identifies genuine tensions (where both sides have validity but
    cannot both be true) as distinguished from mere disagreements or surface conflicts
    that dissolve under analysis.
  probing_questions:
  - What positions are in genuine conflict, not just different but incompatible?
  - Are these tensions acknowledged by the authors or operating beneath awareness?
  - Which tensions are surface-level (easily resolved), structural (deep but potentially
    resolvable), or foundational (constitutive of the discourse itself)?
  - How do tensions relate to each other — do they form hierarchies, networks, or
    isolated pairs?
  - What keeps these tensions in tension rather than resolving?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the most obvious conflicts and disagreements stated in the text.
    standard: Map tensions at multiple levels, trace their relationships, and assess
      which are acknowledged versus hidden.
    deep: Excavate foundational tensions that structure the entire discourse, including
      those the discourse cannot acknowledge without dissolving itself.
- key: binary_system
  description: The either/or distinctions that structure thought and discourse, including
    which term is privileged, what hierarchy governs them, and what third option is
    excluded. Binaries are not innocent organizational tools but power-laden structures
    that enable and constrain what can be thought.
  probing_questions:
  - What binary oppositions organize this discourse (nature/culture, reason/emotion,
    etc.)?
  - Which term in each binary is privileged, and how is this hierarchy maintained?
  - What 'third' positions are excluded by the binary structure — what literally cannot
    be thought?
  - Are these binaries stable, or do they show signs of strain and instability?
  - How do different binaries in the discourse relate to and reinforce each other?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify explicit binary oppositions and note which term seems preferred.
    standard: Analyze the hierarchical structure of binaries, their interdependencies,
      and what they exclude.
    deep: Trace how binaries deconstruct themselves, how the privileged term depends
      on its excluded opposite, and where undecidability emerges.
- key: sublation_dynamics
  description: How contradictions are (or fail to be) resolved through synthesis,
    tracking what gets preserved, what gets destroyed, and whether the resolution
    actually works or merely suppresses the tension. Sublation (Aufhebung) is the
    core dialectical operation, and its analysis reveals whether intellectual progress
    is genuine or illusory.
  probing_questions:
  - Where does the text attempt to resolve or overcome a tension?
  - What elements from each opposing position are preserved in the synthesis?
  - What elements are destroyed or abandoned — and should they have been?
  - Does the synthesis actually resolve the tension or merely displace it?
  - What new tensions does the synthesis itself generate?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note explicit claims to resolve disagreements or reconcile opposites.
    standard: 'Analyze sublation attempts in detail: what is preserved, what is destroyed,
      what new tensions emerge.'
    deep: Evaluate whether sublations are genuine (achieving higher integration) or
      false (suppressing rather than resolving tension), and identify non-identical
      remainders that resist absorption.
- key: internal_contradiction
  description: Points where positions contradict themselves, where theory conflicts
    with practice, or where premises undermine conclusions. Internal contradictions
    are not mere errors but often reveal deeper structural features of a discourse
    — what it cannot consistently maintain but also cannot abandon.
  probing_questions:
  - Where does the text say one thing and do another?
  - Where do stated premises conflict with drawn conclusions?
  - Are there performative contradictions — where the act of stating something contradicts
    what is stated?
  - Which internal contradictions are accidental (fixable) and which are structural
    (constitutive)?
  - How does the text manage or conceal its internal contradictions?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify obvious inconsistencies between claims made in different parts
      of the text.
    standard: Systematically map internal contradictions, distinguishing accidental
      from structural ones, and analyze how they are managed.
    deep: Apply rigorous immanent critique using the text's own stated standards,
      identify performative contradictions, and assess which contradictions are constitutive
      of the discourse's possibility.
- key: exclusion_mapping
  description: What positions, perspectives, or possibilities literally cannot be
    thought within the discourse — the constitutive outside that enables the discourse
    to function. Exclusions are not merely what the text doesn't mention but what
    it structurally cannot accommodate without transforming into something else.
  probing_questions:
  - What positions does the discourse structurally preclude, not just ignore?
  - What would have to change for these excluded positions to become thinkable?
  - Is the exclusion explicit (argued against) or structural (simply unthinkable)?
  - How does what is excluded continue to haunt the discourse — where does it return?
  - What does the pattern of exclusions reveal about the discourse's constitutive
    limits?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note what the text explicitly rejects or argues against.
    standard: Identify positions that are structurally excluded (not just rejected),
      and analyze what makes them unthinkable within this framework.
    deep: Map the full constitutive outside, trace how excluded elements return to
      destabilize the discourse, and identify what the discourse's existence depends
      on excluding.
- key: dialectical_trajectory
  description: The movement and development of the discourse over time or across sections
    — whether it progresses toward resolution, regresses, circles repetitively, or
    spirals through repeated but deepening engagements with the same tensions. Trajectory
    analysis reveals whether dialectical work is actually being done.
  probing_questions:
  - Is there genuine dialectical progress — are tensions being worked through?
  - Does the discourse regress — returning to positions it had seemingly overcome?
  - Is there circular repetition — the same conflicts recurring without development?
  - Is there spiral development — returning to the same tensions at higher levels
    of sophistication?
  - What blocks or enables dialectical movement in this discourse?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Track the sequence of positions and note whether later positions seem
      to advance beyond earlier ones.
    standard: Analyze the pattern of dialectical movement, identifying progress, regression,
      circularity, and spiral development.
    deep: Assess the overall dialectical health of the discourse — whether it is productively
      working through tensions or trapped in unacknowledged repetition — and diagnose
      what conditions would enable genuine progress.
capabilities:
- key: tension_identification
  description: Identifies genuine contradictions where opposing positions each have
    real validity but cannot both be true, distinguishing these from mere disagreements
    that can be resolved by clarification.
  extended_description: |-
    The dialectical tradition's fundamental insight is that not all conflicts are equal. Some apparent contradictions dissolve when terms are clarified — they were never real oppositions, just confusions. Others are genuine but shallow — one side is simply wrong and the tension resolves when we see this. But the most important contradictions are those where both sides capture something real, where the truth is not 'somewhere in the middle' but requires a new framework that preserves what each side got right while transcending their opposition.

    This capability trains attention on the specific markers of genuine dialectical tension: positions that seem to refute each other yet keep recurring, arguments where defeating one side somehow diminishes the force of your own position, claims that require their opposites to be meaningful. It draws on Hegel's analysis of determinate negation — genuine opposition produces specific content — and Adorno's insistence that some tensions must be held open rather than prematurely resolved.

    The practical result is a map of tensions sorted by depth and type: which conflicts are merely apparent, which are real but resolvable, which are constitutive of the discourse and would destroy it if resolved. This sorting is essential for any serious engagement with a text's argumentative structure.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: Hegel
    concept: Determinate negation
    method: Negation of a specific position yields specific positive content rather
      than emptiness; genuine tensions are productive of new thought.
  indicators:
  - Positions that recur despite apparently being refuted
  - Arguments where refuting the opponent weakens one's own case
  - Claims that require their opposites to be meaningful
  - Tensions that authors keep returning to without resolution
  - Debates where each side can predict and articulate the other's objections
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Identify explicit conflicts and disagreements stated in the text.
    standard: Distinguish genuine tensions from apparent ones; sort by depth and resolvability.
    deep: Excavate tensions operating beneath the text's awareness; identify constitutive
      tensions that cannot be resolved without destroying the discourse.

  description: Analyzes the binary oppositions structuring discourse, revealing their
    hierarchies, interdependencies, instabilities, and the third options they exclude.
  extended_description: |-
    Binary oppositions appear throughout human thought: nature/culture, reason/emotion, public/private, mind/body. They seem to be innocent organizational tools, but deconstruction reveals them as power-laden structures with hidden dynamics. One term is always privileged over the other. The hierarchy is maintained through specific rhetorical and conceptual operations. And crucially, the binary excludes a 'third' that doesn't fit — and this exclusion often destabilizes the binary from within.

    This capability applies Derrida's deconstructive method without requiring the reader to know Derrida. It traces how the privileged term secretly depends on what it excludes — how 'culture' needs 'nature' to define itself against, how 'reason' is constituted through the exclusion of 'emotion.' It identifies the excluded third — what cannot be thought within the binary's terms — and traces how this exclusion creates instabilities that eventually undermine the binary itself.

    The result is not the destruction of binary thinking (which would be another binary: binary/non-binary) but a map of how binaries work, where they break down, and what analytical resources become available when we recognize their contingency rather than treating them as natural.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: Derrida
    concept: Différance and supplementarity
    method: Binary oppositions harbor undecidability; the privileged term depends
      on and is contaminated by what it excludes, creating constitutive instability.
  indicators:
  - Explicit or implicit either/or structures organizing argument
  - Terms defined primarily through what they are not
  - Hierarchies where one concept is valued and its opposite denigrated
  - Positions that seem to fall outside available categories
  - Moments where texts struggle to maintain their binary distinctions
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Identify explicit binary oppositions and note which term is preferred.
    standard: Analyze hierarchies, trace dependencies between opposed terms, identify
      excluded thirds.
    deep: Trace how binaries deconstruct themselves, reveal mutual contamination of
      opposed terms, map systems of interlocking binaries.

  description: Evaluates attempts to resolve contradictions through synthesis, tracking
    what is preserved, destroyed, and elevated, and assessing whether resolution is
    genuine or merely apparent.
  extended_description: |-
    Sublation (Aufhebung) is Hegel's untranslatable term for the dialectical operation that simultaneously negates, preserves, and elevates. When done well, sublation transcends opposition while keeping what was valid in each side. But false sublation — premature or forced synthesis — merely suppresses tension without resolving it. The contradiction returns, often in displaced or disguised form.

    This capability provides rigorous analysis of sublation attempts. It tracks three movements: What is negated? The immediate opposition, the either/or that made the contradiction seem irresolvable. What is preserved? The genuine insights from each position that deserve survival. What is elevated? The new synthesis that integrates preserved elements at a higher level. Crucially, it also asks: Does this actually work? Does the synthesis hold, or does it break down under pressure? What new tensions does it generate?

    Adorno's negative dialectics informs a critical stance toward sublation: not all contradictions should be resolved. Some must be held open because premature synthesis does violence to the non-identical — the particular that resists absorption into universal categories. This capability identifies non-identical remainders: what the synthesis claims to integrate but actually excludes or distorts.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: Hegel and Adorno
    concept: Aufhebung and the non-identical
    method: Genuine sublation preserves valid elements of opposition while elevating
      to higher integration; false sublation suppresses tension without resolution.
      The non-identical marks what resists absorption.
  indicators:
  - Claims to reconcile, overcome, or transcend oppositions
  - 'Synthesis vocabulary: ''both/and,'' ''integration,'' ''higher unity'''
  - Arguments that one side 'contains' or 'includes' the other
  - Moments of claimed resolution followed by return of the tension
  - Persistent remainders that don't fit the synthesis
  depth_scaling:

  description: Criticizes positions using their own stated standards and principles,
    revealing where texts fail by their own criteria rather than imposing external
    judgment.
  extended_description: |-
    Immanent critique is the Frankfurt School's most powerful method, and it remains the most devastating form of criticism. To show that a position fails by external standards is to invite the response that those standards are themselves contestable. But to show that a position fails by its own stated standards — that it violates the very principles it claims to uphold — leaves no escape. The position stands self-condemned.

    This capability systematically applies immanent critique. It first identifies a discourse's explicit commitments: what standards does it claim to uphold? what principles does it endorse? what criteria does it apply to others? It then examines whether the discourse itself meets these standards. Does the call for rigor exhibit rigor? Does the demand for inclusivity include all relevant perspectives? Does the critique of ideology reveal its own ideological presuppositions?

    Immanent critique is not gotcha hypocrisy-hunting. The goal is not to embarrass but to illuminate. When a position fails by its own standards, this reveals something important about the position's structure — typically, that it contains internal tensions it has not resolved or acknowledged. The failure opens a path toward more adequate thought.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno)
    concept: Immanent critique
    method: Criticize society or discourse by its own stated standards rather than

      transcendence.
  indicators:
  - Explicit statements of principle, criteria, or standards
  - Methodological commitments stated in introductions or manifestos
  - Criticisms the text makes of others (which it implicitly commits to meeting)
  - Gaps between stated methodology and actual practice

    standard: Systematically identify stated standards and trace where they are met

  description: Reveals how dominant positions secretly depend on what they subordinate,
    following Hegel's master-slave dialectic to trace hidden reliance and potential
    reversal.
  extended_description: |-
    Hegel's master-slave dialectic is one of philosophy's most generative analyses. The master appears to dominate the slave, but examination reveals that the master depends on the slave for recognition (to be a master requires someone to recognize you as such) and for mediated contact with the world (through the slave's labor). Meanwhile, the slave, through labor, develops capacities and self-consciousness the master lacks. The conditions for reversal are built into the structure of domination itself.

    This capability applies the master-slave pattern to any discourse where one position claims dominance over another. The apparently dominant term — whether 'reason' over 'emotion,' 'culture' over 'nature,' 'theory' over 'practice' — is analyzed for its secret dependencies. What does it need from what it subordinates? How would it define itself without its inferior? What capacities does the subordinate position develop that the dominant one lacks?

    This analysis often reveals that hierarchies are less stable than they appear. The dominant position's reliance on what it dominates creates structural vulnerabilities. The subordinate position's excluded knowledge or capabilities become resources for critique. The potential for inversion — not simple reversal but sublation — becomes visible.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: Hegel
    concept: Master-slave dialectic (Herrschaft und Knechtschaft)
    method: The dominant party in any relationship depends on the subordinate for
      recognition and mediated world-relation; this dependency creates conditions
      for transformation.
  indicators:
  - Explicit hierarchies between concepts, positions, or groups
  - Dominant terms defined in opposition to what they subordinate
  - Appeals to the subordinate term at crucial moments in argument
  - Anxiety about maintaining distinction from the subordinate
  - The subordinate position possessing capacities the dominant lacks
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Identify explicit hierarchies and which positions are privileged.
    standard: 'Trace dependencies: what does the dominant position need from what
      it dominates? Identify potential reversals.'
    deep: Map full structure of mutual dependency; assess conditions for genuine sublation
      vs. mere reversal; identify what third positions emerge from destabilized hierarchies.

  description: Evaluates the overall dialectical condition of a discourse — whether
    tensions are being productively worked through or whether the discourse is trapped
    in stagnation, regression, or false synthesis.
  extended_description: |-
    Not all discourses are dialectically equal. Some genuinely work through their tensions, achieving deeper understanding through sustained engagement with contradiction. Others merely circle, returning to the same conflicts without development. Still others regress, abandoning achieved insights to revisit positions that had been transcended. And some achieve only false synthesis — apparent resolution that suppresses rather than genuinely overcomes tension.

    This capability provides overall assessment of a discourse's dialectical health. It asks: Is there progress? Are later formulations more adequate than earlier ones? Does engagement with opposition strengthen positions or merely entrench them? Are contradictions being held productively open (Adorno) or avoided through premature closure? Is the discourse moving toward genuine sublation or trapped in repetition compulsion?

    Dialectical health assessment is not mere evaluation but diagnosis. When a discourse is stuck, this capability identifies what is blocking progress: unacknowledged tensions, false syntheses that need reopening, excluded positions that need inclusion, binary structures that need destabilization. The goal is not to judge but to map conditions for genuine dialectical movement.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: Hegel and Adorno
    concept: Dialectical progress and regression
    method: Genuine dialectic works through contradiction toward higher integration;
      false dialectic circles repetitively, regresses, or achieves only apparent synthesis.
      Diagnosis identifies conditions for productive movement.
  indicators:
  - Later positions engaging with earlier objections vs. ignoring them
  - Increasing sophistication vs. repetition of the same moves
  - Tensions held productively open vs. prematurely closed
  - New positions emerging from conflict vs. entrenchment of old ones
  - Synthesis that generates new problems vs. synthesis that claims completion
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Assess whether the discourse appears to progress or repeat itself.
    standard: 'Analyze patterns of movement: progress, regression, circularity, spiral.
      Identify blocking factors.'
    deep: Full diagnostic assessment of dialectical health; identify conditions for
      productive movement; prescribe what would need to change for genuine progress.
