# THE WHAT: Rich Intellectual Description
# ============================================================

problematique: |
  When an author writes across many works over many years, their concepts
  do not simply sit in isolation -- they evolve, migrate, recombine,
  and sometimes silently contradict their earlier selves. No single
  per-work analysis can reveal this. What is needed is a SYNTHESIS
  ENGINE that takes all the per-work scans and the target profiling
  data and constructs a unified, cross-work picture.

  This engine is the integrator. It receives the outputs of Pass 1
  (deep target profiling: conceptual frameworks, semantic constellations,
  inferential commitments) and Pass 2 (per-work scans: concept evolution
  traces, appropriation tracking across each prior work). From these
  raw materials, it builds: evolution timelines showing how concepts
  change form across the author's body of work; multi-work trace
  aggregations that merge per-work findings into unified per-concept
  summaries; convergence/divergence maps showing where separately
  evolved ideas come together or pull apart; indirect enabler
  analyses revealing how works that never discussed a concept directly
  nevertheless shaped its development through transferred frameworks
  and cognitive habits; and a semantic core -- the stable conceptual
  nucleus that persists beneath surface-level changes.

  The critical question is always: what is the TRAJECTORY? Not just
  what the concept looks like in any single work, but the arc of its
  development. Was this gradual refinement, sharp reversal, silent
  drift, or strategic reframing? What drove each transition -- new
  evidence, changing context, intellectual influence, or strategic
  positioning? And crucially: what was LOST in the evolution, not
  just what was gained? The engine culminates in a critical verdict
  that assesses the coherence and integrity of the author's
  conceptual project as a whole.

  - key: evolution_timelines
    description: >
      Chronological reconstruction of how each significant concept changes
      form across the author's body of work. Each timeline tracks a single
      concept through every work where it appears, noting its form (proto-form,
      full articulation, modified, abandoned), its framing (tentative, qualified,
      definitive, axiomatic, exploratory), and what drove the transition between
      each stage. The evolution pattern is classified: gradual refinement,
      sharp reversal, silent drift, strategic reframe, or consistent deepening.
    probing_questions:
      - "For each concept appearing in 2+ works, what is the chronological sequence of its forms?"
      - "At each stage, how is the concept framed -- tentatively, definitively, axiomatically?"
      - "What drove the transition between stages -- new evidence, new context, new influences, or strategic repositioning?"
      - "Is the overall evolution pattern refinement, reversal, drift, reframe, or deepening?"
      - "How long does the concept's evolution span, and how many works does it traverse?"

  - key: multi_work_trace_aggregation
    description: >
      Merging per-work scan results into unified per-concept summaries.
      Pass 2 produces traces for each prior work separately; this dimension
      aggregates them. Which concepts changed most across the corpus? Which
      remained remarkably stable? Which concepts in the current (target) work
      have no detectable ancestry in prior works -- the orphan concepts that
      appear to be genuine innovations or unacknowledged borrowings from
      outside the author's own corpus?
    probing_questions:
      - "Which concepts show the most dramatic change across the full corpus?"
      - "Which concepts have remained stable -- and is that stability genuine or illusory?"
      - "Which concepts in the target work have no ancestry in any scanned prior work?"
      - "Do orphan concepts suggest genuine innovation, or untraced external influence?"
      - "How consistent is each concept across all the works where it appears?"

      surface: "List most-evolved, most-stable, and orphan concepts with brief notes"
      standard: "Per-concept aggregation summaries, consistency assessments, ranked evolution rankings, and orphan concept analysis with hypotheses about their origins"
      deep: "Full aggregation with cross-concept interaction analysis (how the evolution of concept A drove changes in concept B), deep orphan investigation (tracing possible external sources), and assessment of the corpus's conceptual metabolism -- how quickly and thoroughly the author processes and transforms ideas"

  - key: convergence_divergence
    description: >
      Mapping where ideas from different prior works come together in the
      target work (convergence) and where they conflict or pull in different
      directions (divergence). Convergence points reveal synthesis -- the
      author bringing together threads from different periods or different
      intellectual concerns. Divergence points reveal unresolved tensions
      the author either manages, suppresses, or fails to notice. Hidden
      dependencies -- where the target work's argument depends on specific
      prior evolution paths without acknowledgment -- are especially revealing.
    probing_questions:
      - "Where do ideas from separate prior works converge in the target work?"
      - "How well does the author integrate these converging influences?"
      - "Where do ideas from different prior works create tensions in the target work?"
      - "Does the author acknowledge, resolve, suppress, or ignore these tensions?"

  - key: indirect_enablers
    description: >
      Non-obvious influences that shaped concept development from outside
      the direct lineage. These come from works classified as 'indirect
      contextualizers' or 'different field relevant' in the relationship
      classification pass. An author trained in game theory doesn't just
      borrow specific game-theoretic ideas -- they import a WAY OF THINKING
      that shapes how all their concepts develop. These transferred frameworks,
      foundational patterns, and cross-domain cognitive habits are often
      invisible to the author themselves but powerfully shape the trajectory
      of concept evolution.
    probing_questions:
      - "What foundational patterns from indirect contextualizer works shaped concept development?"
      - "What cognitive frameworks were imported from different-field works?"
      - "Are these indirect influences acknowledged or invisible to the author?"
      - "How did the author's broader intellectual toolkit -- from non-direct-precursor works -- influence trajectories?"

  - key: semantic_core
    description: >
      The stable conceptual nucleus that persists across the author's body
      of work beneath surface-level changes. What definition of each major
      concept integrates all its manifestations? What productive tensions
      remain unresolved? What argumentative role does the concept play across
      texts -- not just within any single work? The semantic core is not a
      lowest-common-denominator definition but a rich synthesis that preserves
      the tensions and evolution while identifying what is genuinely stable.
    probing_questions:
      - "What synthesized definition integrates all perspectives on this concept across texts?"
      - "What key tensions remain productively unresolved within this concept?"
      - "What argumentative role does this concept consistently play across the corpus?"
      - "Is the semantic core genuinely stable, or does surface stability mask deep drift?"
      - "What supporting claims, dependent concepts, and enabling assumptions constitute the argumentative architecture?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "For each major concept, provide a unified definition and note key tensions"
      standard: "Full semantic core analysis with synthesized definitions, tension mapping, argumentative architecture (supporting claims, dependencies, enabling assumptions, logical vulnerabilities), and cross-work role assessment"
      deep: "Deep semantic archaeology: layered definitions showing how meaning accreted over time, full tension analysis with assessment of productive vs destructive tensions, complete argumentative architecture with vulnerability analysis, and comparison of the concept's actual semantic core with the author's stated understanding of it"

    description: >
      The integrative assessment that pulls together all synthesis dimensions
      into a judgment about the author's conceptual project. What works well?
      What doesn't? What intellectual debts remain unacknowledged? What
      alternative paths were available but not taken? The critical verdict
      must be grounded in specific evidence from the synthesis, not
      impressionistic. It separates what was gained from what was lost in
      the evolution, and assesses whether the overall trajectory represents
      genuine intellectual development or accumulation of path-dependent
      commitments.
    probing_questions:
      - "What is the integrated critical assessment of this concept across the body of work?"
      - "What strengths does the conceptual evolution demonstrate?"
      - "What weaknesses or problems does it reveal?"
      - "What intellectual debts does the author not acknowledge?"

          The confrontation pass stress-tested convergences and exposed
          hidden dependencies. Now inhabit the deepest tensions dialectically.
          Intellectual evolution is not a smooth refinement but a process
          driven by internal contradiction — concepts evolve BECAUSE they
          are under pressure from within, not despite it.

          For each major divergence point — where ideas from different works
          pull in opposite directions — perform genuine dialectical work.
          Do not ask which direction is "correct." Ask: what does the
          divergence reveal about what the concept is trying to become?
          When an author's early and late positions on the same concept
          contradict each other, the contradiction is not a mistake to be
          explained away but a record of the concept's own dialectical
          development. The early position contained, in embryo, the seeds
          of its own negation — and the late position is the determinate
          negation that preserved what was valuable while transcending
          what was inadequate.

          For convergence points — where separately evolved ideas come
          together — ask whether the synthesis is genuine Aufhebung or
          mere juxtaposition. A genuine synthesis produces something that
          neither contributing thread could have generated alone. A mere
          juxtaposition places ideas side by side without the collision
          that generates new understanding. Most authors believe their
          convergences are genuine syntheses; dialectical scrutiny often
          reveals they are juxtapositions with synthetic aspirations.

          Trace the longest arcs of contradiction across the corpus.
          Where does the author's thought negate itself most dramatically?
          Where is that negation most productive — yielding the author's
          most original contributions? The hypothesis is that the deepest
          insights emerge not from the stable commitments but from the
          unstable ones: the ideas that the author could never quite
          reconcile, that kept generating new attempts at resolution,
          each attempt itself becoming a contribution.

          drove the evolution, let the semantic core preserve the productive
          tension rather than smoothing it into false coherence. Build
          complete argumentative architecture with vulnerability analysis.
          Render detailed critical verdicts with evidence chains, field-level
