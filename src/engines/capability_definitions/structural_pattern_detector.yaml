  Structure is argument. Before a single claim is evaluated, before evidence is weighed, the arrangement of a text has already done persuasive work. The decision to place a concession in the middle of a paragraph rather than at its end, to bury counterevidence in a footnote, to save the strongest argument for the final section — these are not stylistic preferences but rhetorical strategies. Most readers experience these effects without recognizing their causes. They feel persuaded or unconvinced, engaged or lost, but cannot articulate why. This engine makes the invisible architecture of discourse visible, revealing how the scaffolding of a text shapes the reception of its contents.

  Authors themselves are often only partly aware of their structural choices. Some patterns are inherited from genre conventions — the IMRAD structure of scientific papers, the five-paragraph essay of academic training, the inverted pyramid of journalism. Others emerge from disciplinary habitus, the internalized sense of 'how arguments are supposed to go' that writers absorb through apprenticeship. Still others are strategic, deliberately designed to guide readers toward predetermined conclusions. The most sophisticated authors exploit the gap between structure and content, using organizational patterns that contradict or complicate their explicit arguments. This engine detects all these patterns: the conventional, the habitual, the strategic, and the subversive.

  The intellectual foundation draws from classical rhetoric's dispositio (arrangement) through modern narratology and genre theory. Aristotle understood that the ordering of arguments — what to say first, what to save for last, where to address objections — was as important as the arguments themselves. The Russian Formalists, particularly Shklovsky and Tomashevsky, distinguished fabula (the chronological sequence of events) from syuzhet (the artistic arrangement of those events), revealing how narrative structure creates meaning beyond content. Genette's work on narrative discourse provided tools for analyzing temporal manipulation, focalization, and narrative levels. Genre theorists from Bakhtin to Swales showed how structural conventions carry ideological freight — choosing a genre means inheriting its assumptions about what counts as evidence, who speaks with authority, and how knowledge should be organized.

  Within the logic suite, this engine provides the compositional layer that complements the more granular analyses of other engines. Where argument_architecture maps the logical relationships between claims, this engine reveals how those claims are sequenced and positioned for rhetorical effect. Where dialectical_structure identifies thesis-antithesis-synthesis movements, this engine shows how those movements are paced, emphasized, and embedded within larger organizational patterns. The engine synthesizes across documents in a corpus, identifying recurring structural signatures that reveal disciplinary conventions, authorial habits, or strategic patterns that persist across multiple works.

  Commitment to structural analysis matters because form and content are not separable. The same argument, restructured, becomes a different argument. A defense of free speech that addresses counterarguments in its opening creates a different rhetorical situation than one that saves objections for the final section. A narrative that reveals its conclusion first and then traces how it was reached produces different understanding than one that unfolds chronologically toward surprise. To read critically without attending to structure is to miss half the persuasive apparatus. This engine trains attention on that apparatus, making readers aware of how they are being guided through texts and enabling them to resist or appreciate that guidance with full consciousness.
researcher_question: What structural patterns organize this discourse?
intellectual_lineage:
  primary:
    name: aristotle
    description: Aristotle (384–322 BCE), whose Rhetoric established dispositio (arrangement)
      as one of the five canons of rhetoric, coordinate with invention rather than
      subordinate to it. His analysis of the parts of speech — proem, statement, argument,
      epilogue — and his attention to where different types of arguments should be
      placed (saving strong arguments for the end, addressing objections in the middle)
      provides the foundational framework for understanding structure as a mode of
      persuasion. His recognition that audiences are affected by order and position,
      not just by logical validity, grounds this engine's core insight that arrangement
      does argumentative work.
  secondary:
  - name: genette
    description: Gérard Genette (1930–2018), French narratologist whose Narrative
      Discourse provided the most rigorous vocabulary for analyzing how stories are
      structured. His distinctions between order (chronology vs. presentation), duration
      (how much text-time is devoted to story-time), and frequency (how often events
      are narrated) enable precise analysis of temporal manipulation in any sequential
      text. His concept of focalization — who sees vs. who speaks — extends structural
      analysis beyond sequence to perspective.
  - name: shklovsky
    description: Viktor Shklovsky (1893–1984), Russian Formalist whose distinction
      between fabula and syuzhet revealed that narrative structure is not neutral
      container but active meaning-maker. His concept of defamiliarization (ostranenie)
      showed how structural disruption — placing the familiar in unfamiliar arrangements
      — forces attention and creates new perception. His analysis of how plots are
      'made strange' through structural manipulation provides tools for detecting
      when authors subvert conventional patterns.
  - name: swales
    description: John Swales (1938–), applied linguist whose Genre Analysis established
      the move-step model for analyzing how texts in specific discourse communities
      are structured. His analysis of research article introductions — the CARS (Create
      a Research Space) model — demonstrated that genre structures encode disciplinary
      values and epistemological assumptions. His work grounds the engine's attention
      to how genre conventions shape and constrain structural choices.
  - name: perelman
    description: Chaïm Perelman (1912–1984), Belgian philosopher whose New Rhetoric
      revived attention to the ordering of arguments as a persuasive technique. His
      analysis of how arguments should be arranged differently for different audiences,
      and his attention to 'the order of increasing importance' as a strategic choice,
      provides theoretical grounding for the engine's analysis of strategic placement
      and audience-awareness in structural decisions.
  - name: white
    description: Hayden White (1928–2018), historian and theorist whose Metahistory
      analyzed how historical narratives are 'emplotted' according to different archetypal
      patterns (romance, tragedy, comedy, satire). His insight that the choice of
      plot structure carries ideological implications — that the same historical events
      can be emplotted differently with different political effects — extends structural
      analysis from rhetoric to ideology and from literature to any domain that tells
      stories.
  traditions:
  - name: classical_rhetoric
    description: The Greco-Roman rhetorical tradition from Aristotle through Cicero
      and Quintilian, which treated arrangement as a teachable art with established
      principles. This tradition developed specific guidance for structuring different
      types of speeches (forensic, deliberative, epideictic) and established enduring
      patterns like the six-part oration (exordium, narratio, divisio, confirmatio,
      refutatio, peroratio) that continue to shape academic and legal writing.
  - name: russian_formalism
    description: The early 20th-century movement that treated literary structure as
      an autonomous object of study, separable from content and psychology. Formalists
      like Shklovsky, Tomashevsky, and Propp developed systematic methods for analyzing
      how texts are constructed, treating structure not as transparent medium but
      as productive force that creates meaning through its specific arrangements and
      devices.
  - name: french_narratology
    description: The structuralist approach to narrative developed by Barthes, Todorov,
      and Genette that provided rigorous taxonomies for analyzing narrative structure.
      This tradition distinguished multiple levels of narrative (story, discourse,
      narration), developed vocabularies for temporal manipulation, and revealed the
      'grammar' underlying narrative patterns across diverse texts and genres.
  - name: genre_theory
    description: The tradition running from Bakhtin through contemporary scholars
      like Miller and Bazerman that treats genres as social actions rather than formal
      categories. Genre theorists revealed that structural conventions are not arbitrary
      but encode community values, epistemological assumptions, and power relations.
      Choosing a genre means inheriting its structural constraints and the worldview
      embedded in them.
  - name: composition_studies
    description: The field of writing research that has empirically studied how texts
      are composed and how different structures affect reader comprehension and persuasion.
      Studies of 'given-new' information flow, paragraph coherence, and the effects
      of different organizational patterns on reader understanding provide empirical
      grounding for rhetorical theories of arrangement.
  - name: discourse_analysis
    description: The interdisciplinary field that analyzes language above the sentence
      level, attending to how texts cohere through cohesive devices, thematic progression,
      and information structure. Discourse analysts have developed systematic methods
      for tracking how topics are introduced, developed, and connected, providing
      tools for mapping the information architecture of any text.
  key_concepts:
  - name: dispositio
    definition: The arrangement or organization of arguments and materials in discourse,
      one of the five canons of classical rhetoric. Dispositio recognizes that the
      order in which ideas are presented affects their reception and that strategic
      arrangement is a mode of persuasion distinct from the quality of the arguments
      themselves.
  - name: fabula_syuzhet
    definition: The Formalist distinction between the chronological sequence of events
      as they would have occurred (fabula) and the artistic arrangement in which they
      are presented to the reader (syuzhet). This distinction reveals that all narration
      involves choices about order, selection, and emphasis that shape meaning.
  - name: primacy_recency
    definition: The psychological effects of position in a sequence, where items presented
      first (primacy) and last (recency) tend to be better remembered and more persuasive
      than items in the middle. Strategic placement exploits these effects by positioning
      key arguments at the beginnings and ends of texts and sections.
  - name: cohesion
    definition: The linguistic ties that connect sentences and paragraphs into unified
      text, including reference (pronouns pointing back), conjunction (logical connectives),
      lexical cohesion (repetition and synonymy), and ellipsis. Cohesion analysis
      reveals how tightly or loosely a text's parts are connected.
  - name: information_structure
    definition: The organization of information in terms of what is given (already
      known or established) versus new (being introduced), and what is topic (being
      talked about) versus comment (what is said about it). Information structure
      theory reveals how texts guide readers through the strategic management of knowledge.
  - name: move_analysis
    definition: The identification of functional units in genre-specific texts, where
      a 'move' is a rhetorical action that contributes to the overall purpose of the
      text. Move analysis reveals that texts in specific genres follow predictable
      sequences of functional steps, and that deviation from these sequences carries
      meaning.
  - name: emplotment
    definition: Hayden White's term for the process by which a sequence of events
      is given narrative structure through the imposition of an archetypal plot pattern.
      Emplotment reveals that narrative structure is not discovered but imposed, and
      that different emplotments of the same events carry different meanings and ideological
      implications.
  - name: rhetorical_pacing
    definition: The variation in density and speed across a text, where some sections
      are compressed (many claims per paragraph) while others are expanded (extended
      development of single points). Pacing signals relative importance and guides
      reader attention toward what the author considers most significant.
analytical_dimensions:
- key: argumentative_architecture
  description: The overall logical structure of the argument across the entire text,
    including the sequence of claims, the hierarchical relationships between main
    arguments and supporting points, and the pathways through which the argument develops.
    This dimension maps the text's argumentative skeleton, revealing whether it proceeds
    linearly, branches into parallel tracks, converges from multiple starting points,
    or oscillates dialectically.
  probing_questions:
  - 'What is the main structural pattern: linear progression, branching tree, convergent
    network, or dialectical oscillation?'
  - How many levels of argument hierarchy exist, and how are subordinate claims nested
    within main claims?
  - Where does the argument branch into parallel tracks, and how are these tracks
    eventually integrated?
  - What is the relationship between the argument's logical structure and its physical
    organization into sections?
  - Are there recursive structures where the same argumentative pattern repeats at
    different scales?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the dominant structural pattern (linear, tree, network, dialectical)
      and note major divisions.
    standard: Map the complete argumentative hierarchy with attention to how sections
      serve different functions and how branches reconnect.
    deep: Analyze recursive patterns at multiple scales, detect structural arguments
      (where organization itself makes a claim), and trace how structure guides reader
      cognition through the argument.
- key: narrative_patterning
  description: 'The story-like structures that organize discourse even in non-narrative
    texts, including problem-solution sequences, temporal progressions, causal chains,
    and dramatic arcs. This dimension recognizes that humans naturally process information
    in narrative terms and that even arguments often follow story patterns: a problem
    is introduced, complications arise, resolution is achieved.'
  probing_questions:
  - 'What narrative pattern organizes the discourse: problem-solution, chronological,
    quest, tragedy, comedy?'
  - Is there a narrative arc with identifiable setup, complication, climax, and resolution?
  - How does the text manage suspense, revelation, and reader anticipation?
  - What is the relationship between the order of presentation (syuzhet) and any underlying
    chronology (fabula)?
  - Are there embedded narratives or stories-within-stories, and how do they relate
    to the main argument?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the dominant narrative pattern and note any obvious temporal
      or causal sequences.
    standard: Map the complete narrative arc with attention to pacing, revelation
      timing, and how narrative structure supports or complicates argument.
    deep: Analyze the ideological implications of emplotment choices, detect competing
      narrative frames, and trace how narrative structure guides emotional and cognitive
      engagement.
- key: rhetorical_positioning
  description: The strategic placement of arguments, evidence, concessions, and counterarguments
    within the text's structure, exploiting effects of position (primacy, recency,
    burial) to enhance persuasive impact. This dimension reveals the author's strategic
    awareness and their assumptions about reader psychology.
  probing_questions:
  - What is placed in the opening position, and how does this frame everything that
    follows?
  - What is saved for the final position, and does this suggest a cumulative strategy
    or a climactic revelation?
  - Where are concessions and counterarguments positioned — prominently engaged or
    strategically buried?
  - What appears in the middle sections, and is anything hidden there that the author
    hopes will be overlooked?
  - How does the positioning of weak versus strong arguments suggest awareness of
    primacy and recency effects?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note what appears in opening and closing positions and whether major
      concessions are prominent or buried.
    standard: Map strategic placement throughout with attention to the positioning
      of both strong arguments and potential weaknesses.
    deep: Analyze the rhetorical sophistication of placement choices, detect attempts
      to manipulate reader attention through positioning, and evaluate whether placement
      serves legitimate emphasis or deceptive burial.
- key: transitional_logic
  description: The connective tissue that links sections and paragraphs, including
    explicit transition words, implicit logical relationships, and unmarked juxtapositions.
    This dimension reveals the quality and type of connections between parts, showing
    where arguments flow smoothly and where they leap or stumble.
  probing_questions:
  - 'What types of transitions predominate: logical (therefore, however), temporal
    (then, subsequently), associative (similarly), or unmarked?'
  - Where are transitions weakest, suggesting logical gaps or forced connections?
  - How do paragraph-level transitions differ from section-level transitions?
  - Where does juxtaposition without explicit connection do rhetorical work?
  - Are there false transitions that assert connection without demonstrating it?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Classify dominant transition types and note any obviously weak or missing
      connections.
    standard: Map the transitional logic throughout with attention to how different
      transition types serve different functions.
    deep: Analyze what transition patterns reveal about the author's assumptions regarding
      logical relationships, detect false transitions that mask argumentative gaps,
      and evaluate how transition quality affects argument coherence.
- key: genre_convention_adherence
  description: The degree to which the text follows, modifies, or subverts the structural
    conventions of its genre, and what argumentative work these choices perform. This
    dimension recognizes that genre choice is never neutral and that adherence or
    deviation from genre norms carries meaning.
  probing_questions:
  - What genre(s) does this text belong to, and what structural conventions does that
    genre prescribe?
  - Where does the text follow genre conventions, and what assumptions does this adherence
    carry?
  - Where does the text violate or subvert conventions, and what is the rhetorical
    effect?
  - Does the text hybridize multiple genres, and how does this affect its structural
    logic?
  - What does the genre choice itself argue about how the subject matter should be
    approached?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the primary genre and note major adherences to or deviations
      from its conventions.
    standard: Map systematic convention use with attention to how genre structure
      shapes possible arguments.
    deep: Analyze the ideological implications of genre choice, detect genre hybridization
      and its effects, and evaluate how convention adherence or subversion serves
      the text's persuasive goals.
- key: information_architecture
  description: The management of reader knowledge throughout the text, including what
    information is introduced when, what is withheld for later revelation, what is
    front-loaded as given, and how the reader's understanding evolves through the
    reading process. This dimension maps the 'knowledge gradient' — the changing state
    of what the reader knows at each point.
  probing_questions:
  - What does the reader learn when, and how does this sequence affect understanding?
  - Where is information withheld that could have been revealed earlier, and what
    effect does this delay create?
  - What is treated as given (assumed known) versus new (being introduced), and are
    these assumptions warranted?
  - How does the text manage the balance between providing context and advancing argument?
  - Where might a different information sequence have produced a different understanding
    or response?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note major revelations and their timing, and identify what is assumed
      as given.
    standard: Map the knowledge gradient showing how reader understanding evolves
      through the text.
    deep: Analyze how information architecture guides interpretation, detect strategic
      information management, and evaluate how alternative sequences would affect
      reader response.
capabilities:
- key: argumentative_structure_detection
  description: Identifies and classifies the overall argumentative architecture of
    texts, distinguishing linear, tree, network, dialectical, and convergent structures.
  extended_description: |-
    This capability maps the skeletal structure of argumentation — the logical armature that holds a text's claims together. It recognizes that arguments can proceed in fundamentally different ways: linearly (premise to premise to conclusion), hierarchically (main claims supported by nested sub-claims), dialectically (thesis-antithesis-synthesis), convergently (multiple independent lines converging on one conclusion), or as complex networks with multiple pathways.

    The theoretical grounding comes from informal logic and argumentation theory, particularly Toulmin's model of argument and its extensions. But this capability goes beyond identifying individual arguments to mapping how arguments are assembled into larger structures. A text might contain dozens of individual arguments; the question is how they relate to each other and to the text's overall purpose.

    The capability attends to both explicit structure (sections titled 'Objections and Replies') and implicit structure (the logical relationships that hold even without section breaks). It detects recursive patterns where the same structural logic repeats at different scales — a dialectical pattern within a chapter that mirrors a dialectical pattern across the book.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: Toulmin
    concept: argument structure
    method: Extends Toulmin's analysis of individual arguments to the architectonics
      of complete texts, mapping how claims, warrants, and backing are distributed
      and organized across discourse.
  indicators:
  - Section headings and their logical relationships
  - Transition phrases signaling argumentative moves (therefore, however, building
    on this)
  - Repetition of claims at different levels of the hierarchy
  - Explicit acknowledgment of structure (I will argue in three stages)
  - Patterns of evidence clustering around specific claims
  depth_scaling:

  description: Detects narrative patterns organizing discourse, including problem-solution,
    chronological, causal, quest, and archetypal plot structures.
  extended_description: |-
    Even non-narrative texts often follow narrative logic. Academic papers tell a story: there was a gap in knowledge, a question was posed, methods were employed, results emerged, conclusions were drawn. Philosophical arguments can follow tragic, comic, or romantic emplotments. This capability detects these narrative patterns, recognizing that narrative structure is a fundamental mode of human sense-making that shapes reception even when readers are unaware of its operation.

    The theoretical foundation draws from narratology (Genette, Bal, Prince) and Hayden White's analysis of emplotment. White showed that the same historical events can be emplotted according to different archetypal patterns — as romance (hero overcomes obstacles), tragedy (fall from greatness), comedy (reconciliation after confusion), or satire (exposure of folly) — and that these emplotment choices carry ideological implications. This capability applies the same analysis to any discourse that unfolds in sequence.

    The capability attends to narrative arc (setup, complication, climax, resolution), to the management of suspense and revelation, and to the relationship between the order of presentation and any underlying chronology. It detects embedded narratives and analyzes how stories-within-stories function rhetorically.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: White
    concept: emplotment
    method: Applies White's analysis of how historical narratives are given form through
      archetypal plot patterns to all sequential discourse, revealing narrative structure
      as productive rather than merely descriptive.
  indicators:
  - Temporal markers (then, subsequently, before, after)
  - Problem-solution sequences (the challenge was... the response was...)
  - Character-like agents (the theory, the tradition, the opposition)
  - Rising and falling action patterns in argument intensity
  - Resolution markers (thus, in conclusion, the upshot)

  description: Analyzes the strategic positioning of arguments, evidence, and concessions,
    detecting exploitation of primacy, recency, and burial effects.
  extended_description: |-
    Position matters. The same concession placed at the beginning of a paragraph versus buried in its middle produces different effects. The decision to save the strongest argument for last versus leading with it reflects strategic calculation about how readers will process and remember the discourse. This capability makes these positional strategies visible, revealing the author's assumptions about reader psychology and their degree of rhetorical sophistication.

    The theoretical grounding draws from classical rhetoric's dispositio and modern research in cognitive psychology on serial position effects. Primacy effects mean that what comes first frames everything following; recency effects mean that what comes last lingers in memory. The 'buried' middle position is where skilled authors place material they must include but wish to minimize. Perelman's New Rhetoric provides additional grounding in how arguments should be ordered differently for different audiences and purposes.

    The capability distinguishes legitimate emphasis (placing strong arguments prominently) from manipulative burial (hiding counterevidence in the middle). It attends to the positioning of different types of material — claims, evidence, concessions, qualifications — and asks what the pattern of placement reveals about authorial strategy and assumptions.
  intellectual_grounding:

  description: Maps the connective tissue between sections and paragraphs, classifying
    transition types and detecting logical gaps or forced connections.
  extended_description: |-
    Transitions reveal the author's understanding of how their ideas connect. A 'therefore' claims logical consequence; a 'however' signals opposition; an unmarked juxtaposition leaves the reader to infer the relationship. This capability classifies transitions and evaluates their legitimacy, distinguishing smooth logical flow from forced connections and recognizing where apparent continuity masks actual gaps.

    The theoretical foundation comes from discourse analysis and cohesion theory (Halliday and Hasan). Cohesive devices — reference, conjunction, lexical chains — create textual unity, but cohesion is not coherence. A text can be cohesively tight (many connective words) while lacking genuine logical coherence (the connections don't hold). This capability distinguishes the appearance of connection from its reality.

    The capability attends to patterns in transition use. Do transitions tend to be logical or temporal or associative? Where are transitions weakest or absent? Are there false transitions — explicit connective words that assert connection without demonstrating it? The pattern of transitions reveals how the author conceptualizes the relationships among their ideas and where their argumentative confidence is strongest and weakest.

  description: Analyzes adherence to and deviation from genre structural conventions,
    revealing how genre choice shapes possible arguments.
  extended_description: |-
    Genres are not merely formal containers but social actions that carry expectations, constraints, and implicit arguments about how knowledge should be organized. Choosing to write a research article rather than an essay, a manifesto rather than a treatise, a literature review rather than an original argument — these are not neutral choices but commitments to particular ways of knowing and communicating. This capability detects genre conventions and analyzes what work adherence or deviation performs.

    The theoretical grounding draws from rhetorical genre theory (Miller, Bazerman, Swales), which treats genres as typified responses to recurring social situations. Swales's move analysis provides tools for identifying the functional units that constitute genre-specific texts. The CARS model for research article introductions, for instance, shows that introductions establish territory, establish a niche, and occupy the niche — a predictable sequence of moves that structures what can be said and how.

    The capability detects genre hybridization, where texts combine conventions from multiple genres, and analyzes the rhetorical effects of such mixing. It also attends to genre violation — moments where a text breaks with convention — asking whether violation serves a purpose or merely reflects lack of genre awareness.

  description: Tracks how information is managed through the text, mapping revelation
    timing, given-new relationships, and the evolving knowledge gradient.
  extended_description: |-
    Texts manage reader knowledge. They decide what to reveal when, what to assume as already known, what to withhold for later revelation. The sequence in which information is presented shapes understanding — the same facts, differently sequenced, produce different interpretations. This capability tracks information flow, mapping the 'knowledge gradient' that shows how reader understanding evolves through the reading process.

    The theoretical grounding comes from information structure theory (Halliday, Prince, Lambrecht), which analyzes how languages organize information in terms of given versus new and topic versus focus. Given information (assumed known) provides context; new information (being introduced) provides content. The balance and sequencing of given and new affects comprehension — too much new information overwhelms; too much given bores.

    The capability attends to revelation timing: when does the reader learn key facts, and what would change if they learned them earlier or later? It detects strategic information management — withholding information for dramatic effect, front-loading context to frame interpretation, burying inconvenient facts in technically accurate but easy-to-miss formulations. It asks whether information flow serves reader comprehension or author strategy.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: Lambrecht
    concept: information structure
    method: Applies information structure theory to track how given-new sequencing
      and revelation timing shape reader understanding and interpretation.
  indicators:
  - Contextualizing moves before introducing new claims
  - Delayed revelation (the twist was...)
  - Front-loading of key definitions or assumptions
  - Repetition of established information when introducing new claims
  - Explicit management of reader knowledge (as we saw earlier, we will soon see that)
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Note major revelations and their timing, identify front-loaded context
    standard: Map knowledge gradient showing reader understanding evolution
    deep: Analyze strategic information management, evaluate alternative sequences,
      detect manipulation of reader understanding
