  How do key terms and concepts evolve between an author's prior work
  and their current work? When the same word appears in two texts
  separated by years, it rarely means the same thing. Concepts are
  living entities: they are born, mutate, merge, split, and sometimes
  die -- replaced by successors that carry traces of their ancestors.

  This engine performs multi-dimensional comparison between a prior work
  and the current work's profile (established in Pass 1). It does not
  merely track whether a concept appears in both places. It asks: has
  the VOCABULARY shifted -- are the same terms used, or have new terms
  replaced old ones? Has the METHODOLOGY changed -- does the author
  argue for the same ideas using different evidence or analytical moves?
  Have the METAPHORS evolved -- are the same images deployed, or have
  they been abandoned for new ones? Has the FRAMING changed -- was
  something once tentative now presented as axiomatic?

  These four dimensions -- vocabulary, methodology, metaphor, framing --
  constitute the engine's analytical lens. Each dimension can reveal
  genealogical connections invisible to the others. Two works may share
  no vocabulary but identical methodological signatures (foundational
  influence). A concept may retain its name but undergo complete metaphor
  replacement (deep reconceptualization masked by terminological continuity).

  This is the FIRST engine in the prior work scanning chain (Pass 2).
  It runs once per prior work, producing per-work dimensional comparisons
  that feed into concept_appropriation_tracker and downstream synthesis.

  description: |
    Track the birth, death, and mutation of terms between the prior work and the current work. Which terms are shared? Which appeared in the prior work but were later abandoned or renamed? When the same term persists, has its meaning drifted? Vocabulary comparison is the most reliable surface signal for tracing direct genealogical connections.
  probing_questions:
  - What terms appear in both the prior work and the current work?
  - Which terms from the prior work have been abandoned -- and what replaced them?
  - When the same term persists, has its meaning shifted (semantic drift)?

    work?

    trajectory?

- key: methodology_evolution
  description: |
    Compare how the author argues for similar ideas across works. Do they use the same evidence types, the same analytical moves, the same reasoning patterns? Methodological consistency across different subject matter is a strong signal of foundational influence. Methodological divergence may reveal paradigm shifts or intellectual maturation.
  probing_questions:
  - Does the author use the same types of evidence in both works?
  - Are the same analytical moves deployed -- the same patterns of argument?
  - Has the author's relationship to empirical data changed?
  - Have the reasoning patterns become more or less formal?
  - Does methodological change track with or diverge from vocabulary change?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note whether the same general approach is used in both works
    standard: Compare specific analytical moves, evidence types, and reasoning patterns
      with examples from both texts
    deep: 'Full methodological comparison: map the complete analytical toolkit in

      from Pass 1'
- key: metaphor_evolution
  description: |
    Compare the metaphors used to convey key ideas across works. Metaphors are not decorative -- they structure thought. When an author switches from mechanical metaphors to organic ones, or from spatial to temporal metaphors, something deep has changed in how they conceptualize the problem. Metaphor migration across works reveals intellectual continuities invisible at the vocabulary or methodology level.
  probing_questions:
  - What governing metaphors appear in the prior work, and do they persist?
  - Have metaphors evolved -- simpler to more elaborate, or replaced entirely?
  - Do new metaphors in the current work have precursor forms in the prior work?
  - What does metaphor change reveal about shifts in how the author SEES the problem?
  - Are there dead metaphors from the prior work that have become literal terms?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the dominant metaphors in each work and note changes
    standard: Map metaphor evolution with examples, classify changes (elaboration,
      replacement, literalization), and assess what the metaphor shifts reveal about
      conceptual change

      source domain analysis (where metaphors come from), interaction with vocabulary
      and methodology changes, and assessment of whether metaphor shifts are leading
      or lagging indicators of conceptual change'
- key: framing_evolution
  description: |
    Track how the author frames the same or related problems across works. Framing analysis captures the confidence trajectory of ideas: was something presented tentatively before but definitively now? Was an idea exploratory in the prior work but axiomatic in the current one? Framing shifts are CRITICAL for downstream tactic detection -- escalation, silent revision, and strategic reframing are all visible through the framing lens.
  probing_questions:
  - How was this idea framed in the prior work -- tentative, qualified, definitive,
    axiomatic, exploratory?
  - How is the same idea framed now -- has confidence increased, decreased, or changed
    character?
  - Has the PROBLEM being addressed been reframed -- same question asked differently?
  - Are there ideas that were once hedged that are now presented as established?
  - Does the framing shift track with evidence changes, or is it rhetorical?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note the most obvious framing shifts (tentative-to-definitive, etc.)

- key: concept_trajectory
  description: |
    Trace the lifecycle of individual concepts between the prior work and the current work. A concept may undergo expansion (taking on more meaning), narrowing (becoming more precise), reversal (meaning the opposite), splitting (becoming two concepts), or merger (absorbing another). Each trajectory type has different genealogical significance.
  probing_questions:
  - What evolution type characterizes each shared concept -- expansion, narrowing,
    reversal, splitting, merger?
  - What triggered each conceptual change -- new evidence, new interlocutors, internal
    logic?
  - Are there concepts that split in the prior work and recombined in the current
    work, or vice versa?
  - Which concepts show the most dramatic transformation?
  - Are there concepts that appear stable but have undergone subtle internal reorganization?

- key: dimensional_comparison_matrix
  description: |
    The synthetic view: how do vocabulary, methodology, metaphor, and framing changes interact for each concept? A concept may show vocabulary continuity but methodological divergence (same word, different argument). Or metaphor change but framing stability (new imagery, same confidence level). The matrix reveals which dimensions are coupled and which are independent -- a key diagnostic for understanding the nature of intellectual change.
  probing_questions:
  - For each key concept, which dimensions changed and which remained stable?
  - Are vocabulary changes correlated with methodology changes, or independent?
  - Do metaphor shifts predict framing shifts, or are they decoupled?
  - Where do all four dimensions change simultaneously -- indicating genuine reconceptualization?
  - Where do all four dimensions remain stable -- indicating true intellectual continuity?

    This capability performs Koselleckian Begriffsgeschichte on the author's own conceptual vocabulary, treating each term as carrying sedimented layers of meaning that accumulate, shift, or erode across time. It does not merely identify shared words between prior and current work, but traces semantic drift—the phenomenon where a term retains its orthographic form while its conceptual content transforms. The capability distinguishes genuine neologisms from terminological replacements (where a new word captures what an old word once meant), from semantic mutations (where the same word now does different work), from dead metaphors that have calcified into technical terms. Each type of vocabulary change has distinct genealogical significance: replacements suggest deliberate distancing from prior formulations, mutations suggest conceptual drift that may be unconscious, and literalization of metaphors suggests a concept has achieved theoretical maturity.

    This capability provides the foundational inventory for all other dimensional analyses. Without accurate vocabulary mapping, methodology comparison becomes impossible—you cannot determine whether analytical moves have changed if you cannot reliably identify when the same concept is being discussed. It feeds directly into concept_trajectory analysis by establishing the terminological boundaries of concepts, and into framing_evolution by providing the linguistic evidence for confidence shifts. The challenge is distinguishing homonyms (same word, unrelated meanings across works) from polysemes (same word, related meanings) from genuine semantic continuity with drift. A naive approach treats orthographic identity as conceptual identity; a sophisticated approach recognizes that vocabulary stability can mask profound reconceptualization, while vocabulary change can disguise underlying continuity.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: koselleck
    concept: begriffsgeschichte
    method: Koselleck's method treats concepts as contested, temporally indexed semantic
      fields rather than stable definitions. Vocabulary evolution is traced by identifying
      the Erwartungshorizont (horizon of expectation) and Erfahrungsraum (space of
      experience) encoded in each term's usage, revealing how changing historical
      conditions sediment into conceptual meaning.
  indicators:
  - The same term appears in both works but is defined differently or used in incompatible
    contexts
  - A central term from the prior work is conspicuously absent from the current work,
    with no obvious replacement
  - New compound terms in the current work combine roots from the prior work in novel
    configurations
  - The author explicitly flags that they are using a familiar term 'in a new sense'
    or distances themselves from prior usage
  - Surrounding vocabulary has changed while a key term persists, suggesting the term
    now operates in a different semantic field

  extended_description: |-
    This capability performs analytical signature comparison across works, identifying the author's characteristic moves of thought—the recursive patterns of evidence-gathering, argument-building, and conceptual justification that persist across different subject matter. Following Kuhn's insight that paradigms are defined less by explicit doctrine than by shared exemplars and problem-solving techniques, this capability treats methodology as the deep grammar of intellectual practice. It distinguishes between surface-level topic shifts (writing about different things) and genuine methodological transformation (thinking in fundamentally different ways about any topic). The capability tracks what types of phenomena count as evidence, what forms of argumentation are deployed, whether reasoning is inductive or deductive, whether the author privileges formal analysis or thick description, and whether empirical data is treated as theory-neutral observation or theory-laden interpretation.

    Methodology comparison is particularly powerful for detecting foundational influence that operates beneath vocabulary level. An author may abandon all the terminology of their earlier work while retaining its analytical habits—or conversely, may preserve vocabulary while completely transforming how they argue. This capability enables dimensional_comparison_matrix to identify 'methodology-led change' (where new analytical tools drive conceptual revision) versus 'vocabulary-led change' (where terminological innovation precedes methodological adaptation). The non-trivial challenge is distinguishing methodological evolution that represents progressive sophistication (adding tools to the toolkit) from paradigmatic rupture (switching toolkits entirely). A naive comparison notes whether 'the author still uses case studies'; a sophisticated comparison asks whether case studies now do different epistemic work, whether they are selected by different criteria, and whether they stand in different relationships to theoretical claims.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: kuhn
    concept: paradigm_exemplar
    method: Kuhn argued that scientific paradigms are transmitted through exemplary
      problem-solutions that demonstrate how to do research, not through explicit
      methodological rules. This capability identifies the author's exemplars—the
      characteristic ways they approach problems—and tracks whether these exemplars
      persist, evolve, or undergo revolutionary replacement across works.
  indicators:
  - The author makes similar types of arguments (e.g., inference to best explanation,
    reduction to absurdity) in both works despite different subject matter
  - Evidence types shift dramatically (e.g., from ethnographic observation to quantitative
    data, or from textual exegesis to experimental results)
  - Relationship to counterexamples changes (e.g., from addressing them extensively
    to dismissing them, or from treating them as falsifiers to treating them as limiting
    cases)
  - Level of formalization changes (e.g., from informal prose to mathematical models,
    or from axiomatic systems to narrative accounts)
  - The author explicitly reflects on methodological changes ('my earlier approach
    was limited by...', 'I now realize that...')

      historical analysis', 'conceptual genealogy') is used in both works

  extended_description: |-
    This capability performs cognitive archaeology on the author's conceptual imagery, recognizing with Lakoff that metaphors are not decorative rhetorical flourishes but the fundamental structures through which abstract concepts are made thinkable. It traces the source domains (concrete, embodied experiences) that the author maps onto target domains (abstract theoretical constructs) and tracks how these mappings evolve. When an author shifts from mechanical metaphors (systems, mechanisms, functions) to organic metaphors (growth, evolution, ecology), or from spatial metaphors (boundaries, territories, positions) to temporal metaphors (development, trajectories, genealogies), the shift signals a transformation in the underlying ontology of their thought. The capability distinguishes governing metaphors (pervasive structural mappings that organize entire domains of thought) from occasional analogies, and tracks metaphor lifecycles: birth (new source domain introduced), elaboration (existing metaphor extended to new entailments), competition (multiple metaphors for the same concept), replacement (one source domain supplants another), and literalization (dead metaphors that become technical vocabulary).

    Metaphor analysis reveals intellectual continuities that vocabulary and methodology tracking miss. Two works may share no technical terms and employ different analytical methods, yet deploy identical metaphorical structures—a signal of deep cognitive continuity beneath surface change. Conversely, metaphor replacement while vocabulary persists indicates genuine reconceptualization masked by terminological conservation. This capability feeds framing_evolution by identifying when metaphor shifts correlate with confidence changes (tentative exploration often uses hedged, qualified metaphors; definitive claims use bold, extended metaphors), and enables dimensional_comparison_matrix to detect 'metaphor-first reconceptualization' where cognitive imagery drives subsequent terminological and methodological changes. The challenge is distinguishing live metaphors (that genuinely structure thought and generate novel entailments) from dead metaphors (fossilized in conventional usage) from purely ornamental analogies.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: lakoff
    concept: conceptual_metaphor_theory
    method: Lakoff's cognitive linguistics demonstrates that abstract reasoning depends
      on systematic mappings from concrete source domains to abstract target domains.
      This capability identifies these mappings by analyzing the systematic entailments
      and inferences that metaphors generate, tracking which source domains the author
      recruits and how these choices constrain subsequent theoretical possibilities.
  indicators:
  - Recurring patterns of imagery appear across multiple discussions of a concept
    (e.g., repeatedly describing social structures using architectural metaphors)
  - The author extends a metaphor to generate novel inferences or predictions ('if
    society is an organism, then...')
  - A previously dominant metaphor disappears entirely or is explicitly rejected ('the
    mechanical model fails to capture...')
  - Mixed metaphors appear, suggesting the author is transitioning between conceptual
    frameworks
  - The author mobilizes a metaphor from one domain (e.g., biology) when discussing
    a different domain (e.g., economics), suggesting cross-domain conceptual transfer

  produces_dimensions:
  - framing_evolution
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability performs epistemic confidence trajectory analysis, tracking how the author's stance toward their own ideas evolves across works. Drawing on Skinner's contextualist insight that intellectual acts are rhetorical performances shaped by strategic communicative goals, it recognizes that the same propositional content can be framed as tentative hypothesis, qualified claim, definitive assertion, axiomatic foundation, or exploratory speculation—and that these framing differences are not merely ornamental but epistemically and strategically significant. The capability identifies linguistic markers of epistemic stance (modal verbs, hedging devices, qualification patterns, assertion strength, evidential basis claims) and maps confidence trajectories: ideas that were once presented with heavy hedging now asserted definitively, questions that were once central now treated as settled, claims that were once boldly stated now qualified into irrelevance. Each trajectory type has distinct genealogical and tactical significance: escalation (increasing confidence, often correlated with accumulated evidence or disciplinary acceptance), de-escalation (decreasing confidence, possibly due to counterevidence or strategic retreat), and reframing (changing the question being asked rather than the answer given).

    Framing analysis is critical for downstream tactic detection engines (concept_appropriation_tracker, revisionist_historiography_detector) because rhetorical shifts often precede or accompany conceptual maneuvers. An author who silently escalates confidence without corresponding evidence changes may be engaged in strategic positioning; an author who reframes a problem to make their earlier claims appear prescient may be practicing retrospective vindication. This capability feeds directly into concept_trajectory by providing the epistemic dimension of concept evolution (did the concept itself change, or just the author's confidence in it?), and enables dimensional_comparison_matrix to identify 'framing-led change' versus 'evidence-led change'. The challenge is distinguishing legitimate epistemic confidence increases (based on accumulated evidence, theoretical integration, or empirical validation) from rhetorical confidence increases (strategic assertion unsupported by evidential gains). A naive analysis notes whether claims are hedged or unhedged; a sophisticated analysis tracks the relationship between confidence trajectories and evidential trajectories, identifying when they diverge.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: skinner
    concept: rhetorical_contextualism
    method: Skinner's Cambridge School approach treats intellectual texts as performative
      speech acts situated in rhetorical contexts. Authors frame arguments strategically
      to anticipate objections, claim novelty, or position themselves relative to
      rivals. This capability identifies framing devices and tracks how they shift
      as the author's strategic context evolves across works.
  indicators:
  - Modal verb usage changes dramatically (e.g., 'might' and 'could' in the prior
    work become 'must' and 'will' in the current work)
  - Ideas previously flagged as 'preliminary', 'exploratory', or 'speculative' are
    presented without such qualifications in later work
  - The author provides explicit retrospective reframing ('what I was really arguing
    was...', 'the earlier formulation obscured the key insight...')
  - 'Hedging patterns change: claims previously surrounded by disclaimers and scope
    limitations are asserted more boldly'
  - 'Problem formulations shift: a question previously marked as open or contested
    is now treated as settled or foundational'

  extended_description: |-
    This capability performs conceptual genealogy and lifecycle analysis, treating concepts as living entities that undergo birth, growth, transformation, splitting, merging, and death. Following Wittgenstein's insight that concepts have family resemblance structures rather than necessary and sufficient conditions, it recognizes that conceptual identity across time is often a matter of overlapping similarities and continuous chains of connection rather than preservation of essential features. The capability classifies concept evolution types: expansion (the concept takes on additional meaning, covering more phenomena or carrying more theoretical weight), narrowing (the concept becomes more precise, shedding connotations or restricting scope), reversal (the concept comes to mean something opposed to its earlier meaning—a particularly significant genealogical event), splitting (one concept becomes two, usually through disambiguation or theoretical differentiation), merger (multiple concepts collapse into one, suggesting theoretical unification or loss of distinction), and replacement (the concept is abandoned in favor of a successor that performs similar work). Each trajectory type has distinct intellectual significance: splitting often signals theoretical maturation and increased sophistication; merger can signal either productive synthesis or impoverishing reduction; reversal suggests either recognition of prior error or adaptation to new evidence that inverts earlier understanding.

    This capability integrates vocabulary, metaphor, and framing analyses to produce concept-level genealogies. A concept may undergo vocabulary mutation (new terms), metaphor replacement (new imagery), and framing escalation (increased confidence) simultaneously—suggesting coherent reconceptualization. Or these dimensions may diverge: vocabulary stability with metaphor change suggests deep reconceptualization masked by terminological continuity. Concept lifecycles feed into dimensional_comparison_matrix as the unit of synthetic analysis, and provide critical input for downstream engines detecting conceptual appropriation or revisionist historiography. The challenge is identifying when a concept has genuinely evolved versus when an author has simply relabeled ideas, and distinguishing productive conceptual transformation from degenerative drift. A naive approach treats vocabulary changes as concept changes; a sophisticated approach recognizes that concepts can persist across terminological shifts and can fragment despite terminological stability.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: wittgenstein
    concept: family_resemblance
    method: 'Wittgenstein argued that concepts are not defined by essential properties
      but by networks of overlapping similarities, like family resemblances. This
      capability traces conceptual evolution by identifying similarity chains across
      works: a concept may transform gradually through intermediate stages where each
      stage resembles its predecessor, even if the endpoints share little apparent
      similarity.'
  indicators:
  - The same concept name appears in both works but is used to explain different phenomena
    or solve different problems
  - A previously unified concept is now discussed under multiple separate headings
    or with explicit differentiation
  - Multiple concepts from the prior work are now discussed under a single unified
    framework or vocabulary term
  - The author explicitly marks conceptual revision ('my earlier notion of X was too

    This capability produces the integrative synthesis that makes concept evolution analysis genuinely multi-dimensional rather than merely multi-aspect. For each concept traced between prior and current work, it constructs a four-dimensional comparison matrix showing whether vocabulary, methodology, metaphor, and framing have changed or remained stable—and more importantly, how these dimensions interact. The matrix reveals coupling patterns: dimensions that change together (suggesting coordinated reconceptualization) versus dimensions that change independently (suggesting surface transformation masking deep continuity, or vice versa). It identifies change archetypes: 'vocabulary-led change' (where terminological innovation drives subsequent methodological and metaphorical adaptation), 'methodology-led change' (where new analytical tools force conceptual revision), 'metaphor-first reconceptualization' (where new imagery enables previously unthinkable formulations), and 'framing-only change' (where rhetorical stance shifts without corresponding conceptual transformation). Each archetype has distinct genealogical significance and implies different relationships between prior and current work.

    The matrix enables identification of intellectual continuities invisible to single-dimension analysis. A concept may show complete vocabulary replacement but perfect methodological continuity—signaling terminological distancing from a framework whose analytical habits persist. Or vocabulary and metaphor may remain stable while methodology transforms—suggesting an author is using old language to do genuinely new work. The capability provides the synthetic view required for downstream engines to assess appropriation tactics (did the author genuinely engage with the prior work or merely harvest vocabulary?) and to evaluate intellectual honesty (are claimed breakthroughs genuine reconceptualizations or rebranded continuities?). The challenge is avoiding false positives where apparent coupling is coincidental, and false negatives where genuine coupling is obscured by complex mediating factors. A naive synthesis reports change/stability in each dimension independently; a sophisticated synthesis identifies second-order patterns in how dimensions interact, revealing the author's characteristic pathways of conceptual change.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: koselleck
    concept: semantic_field_analysis
    method: Koselleck analyzed concepts not in isolation but as elements of semantic
      fields where changes in one concept ripple through related concepts and dimensions.
      This capability treats the four dimensions (vocabulary, methodology, metaphor,
      framing) as constituting a semantic field for each concept, identifying how
      perturbations in one dimension propagate through others or remain isolated.
  indicators:
  - Changes across multiple dimensions appear coordinated (e.g., vocabulary change
    accompanies metaphor change and framing shift for the same concept)
  - One dimension changes while others remain stable (e.g., new vocabulary but identical
    metaphors and methodology)
  - All four dimensions remain stable across works for certain concepts but change
    for others, suggesting selective conceptual revision
  - The author's explicit reflections on their intellectual development mention some
    dimensions (e.g., 'methodological refinement') but not others (metaphors, framing)
  - Similar coupling patterns appear across multiple concepts, suggesting systematic
    relationships between dimensions rather than concept-specific accidents

    surface: Summary statistics showing which dimensions changed most frequently across
      all concepts, with 2-3 examples of different change patterns
    standard: Per-concept matrix showing change/stability across all four dimensions
      with brief supporting evidence, identification of 3-5 dominant coupling patterns
      (e.g., 'vocabulary and metaphor change together but methodology remains stable'),
      and preliminary archetype classification
    deep: Complete dimensional matrix for every traced concept with detailed coupling
      analysis, identification of change archetypes (vocabulary-led, methodology-led,
      metaphor-first, framing-only, etc.), systematic assessment of whether coupling
      patterns are concept-specific or systematic across the author's work, second-order
      pattern analysis revealing how dimensions interact, and diagnostic assessment
      of what coupling patterns reveal about the author's intellectual process (whether
      they are vocabulary-first thinkers, methodology-first thinkers, etc.)

      Scan for shared concepts between prior and current work. Note
      obvious vocabulary changes (births, deaths, renames) and list
      the dominant evolution types (expansion, narrowing, reversal).
      At surface depth this is a quick scan for the strongest signals.
