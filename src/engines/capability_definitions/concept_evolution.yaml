problematique: |
  How do key terms and concepts evolve between an author's prior work
  and their current work? When the same word appears in two texts
  separated by years, it rarely means the same thing. Concepts are
  living entities: they are born, mutate, merge, split, and sometimes
  die -- replaced by successors that carry traces of their ancestors.

  This engine performs multi-dimensional comparison between a prior work
  and the current work's profile (established in Pass 1). It does not
  merely track whether a concept appears in both places. It asks: has
  the VOCABULARY shifted -- are the same terms used, or have new terms
  replaced old ones? Has the METHODOLOGY changed -- does the author
  argue for the same ideas using different evidence or analytical moves?
  Have the METAPHORS evolved -- are the same images deployed, or have
  they been abandoned for new ones? Has the FRAMING changed -- was
  something once tentative now presented as axiomatic?

  These four dimensions -- vocabulary, methodology, metaphor, framing --
  constitute the engine's analytical lens. Each dimension can reveal
  genealogical connections invisible to the others. Two works may share
  no vocabulary but identical methodological signatures (foundational
  influence). A concept may retain its name but undergo complete metaphor
  replacement (deep reconceptualization masked by terminological continuity).

  This is the FIRST engine in the prior work scanning chain (Pass 2).
  It runs once per prior work, producing per-work dimensional comparisons
  that feed into concept_appropriation_tracker and downstream synthesis.

analytical_dimensions:

  - key: vocabulary_evolution
    description: >
      Track the birth, death, and mutation of terms between the prior work
      and the current work. Which terms are shared? Which appeared in the
      prior work but were later abandoned or renamed? When the same term
      persists, has its meaning drifted? Vocabulary comparison is the most
      reliable surface signal for tracing direct genealogical connections.
    probing_questions:
      - "What terms appear in both the prior work and the current work?"
      - "Which terms from the prior work have been abandoned -- and what replaced them?"
      - "When the same term persists, has its meaning shifted (semantic drift)?"
      - "Are there neologisms in the current work that have precursor forms in the prior work?"
      - "What does the pattern of vocabulary birth/death reveal about the author's intellectual trajectory?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "List shared terms and obvious replacements between the two works"
      standard: "Map vocabulary with semantic drift analysis, precursor-successor relationships, and evidence from both texts showing meaning shifts"
      deep: "Full vocabulary archaeology: complete term inventory for both works, detailed drift analysis with quoted evidence, vocabulary clusters that reveal conceptual reorganization, and assessment of whether terminological changes reflect genuine reconceptualization or mere relabeling"

  - key: methodology_evolution
    description: >
      Compare how the author argues for similar ideas across works. Do they
      use the same evidence types, the same analytical moves, the same
      reasoning patterns? Methodological consistency across different subject
      matter is a strong signal of foundational influence. Methodological
      divergence may reveal paradigm shifts or intellectual maturation.
    probing_questions:
      - "Does the author use the same types of evidence in both works?"
      - "Are the same analytical moves deployed -- the same patterns of argument?"
      - "Has the author's relationship to empirical data changed?"
      - "Have the reasoning patterns become more or less formal?"
      - "Does methodological change track with or diverge from vocabulary change?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Note whether the same general approach is used in both works"
      standard: "Compare specific analytical moves, evidence types, and reasoning patterns with examples from both texts"
      deep: "Full methodological comparison: map the complete analytical toolkit in each work, identify which tools were added/dropped/modified, assess whether changes are progressive (building sophistication) or paradigmatic (switching frameworks), and match against the target work's methodological signatures from Pass 1"

  - key: metaphor_evolution
    description: >
      Compare the metaphors used to convey key ideas across works. Metaphors
      are not decorative -- they structure thought. When an author switches
      from mechanical metaphors to organic ones, or from spatial to temporal
      metaphors, something deep has changed in how they conceptualize the
      problem. Metaphor migration across works reveals intellectual continuities
      invisible at the vocabulary or methodology level.
    probing_questions:
      - "What governing metaphors appear in the prior work, and do they persist?"
      - "Have metaphors evolved -- simpler to more elaborate, or replaced entirely?"
      - "Do new metaphors in the current work have precursor forms in the prior work?"
      - "What does metaphor change reveal about shifts in how the author SEES the problem?"
      - "Are there dead metaphors from the prior work that have become literal terms?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Identify the dominant metaphors in each work and note changes"
      standard: "Map metaphor evolution with examples, classify changes (elaboration, replacement, literalization), and assess what the metaphor shifts reveal about conceptual change"
      deep: "Full metaphor archaeology: complete metaphor inventory, evolution trajectories, source domain analysis (where metaphors come from), interaction with vocabulary and methodology changes, and assessment of whether metaphor shifts are leading or lagging indicators of conceptual change"

  - key: framing_evolution
    description: >
      Track how the author frames the same or related problems across works.
      Framing analysis captures the confidence trajectory of ideas: was
      something presented tentatively before but definitively now? Was an
      idea exploratory in the prior work but axiomatic in the current one?
      Framing shifts are CRITICAL for downstream tactic detection --
      escalation, silent revision, and strategic reframing are all visible
      through the framing lens.
    probing_questions:
      - "How was this idea framed in the prior work -- tentative, qualified, definitive, axiomatic, exploratory?"
      - "How is the same idea framed now -- has confidence increased, decreased, or changed character?"
      - "Has the PROBLEM being addressed been reframed -- same question asked differently?"
      - "Are there ideas that were once hedged that are now presented as established?"
      - "Does the framing shift track with evidence changes, or is it rhetorical?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Note the most obvious framing shifts (tentative-to-definitive, etc.)"
      standard: "Map framing changes with source/target classifications (tentative/qualified/definitive/axiomatic/exploratory), evidence for the shift, and assessment of whether the shift is epistemically justified"
      deep: "Full framing analysis: complete framing inventory for shared ideas, confidence trajectories plotted across works, interaction with vocabulary/methodology/metaphor changes, assessment of epistemic vs. rhetorical motivation for shifts, and identification of framing patterns that signal specific downstream tactics"

  - key: concept_trajectory
    description: >
      Trace the lifecycle of individual concepts between the prior work
      and the current work. A concept may undergo expansion (taking on
      more meaning), narrowing (becoming more precise), reversal (meaning
      the opposite), splitting (becoming two concepts), or merger (absorbing
      another). Each trajectory type has different genealogical significance.
    probing_questions:
      - "What evolution type characterizes each shared concept -- expansion, narrowing, reversal, splitting, merger?"
      - "What triggered each conceptual change -- new evidence, new interlocutors, internal logic?"
      - "Are there concepts that split in the prior work and recombined in the current work, or vice versa?"
      - "Which concepts show the most dramatic transformation?"
      - "Are there concepts that appear stable but have undergone subtle internal reorganization?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Identify 3-5 key concepts and their evolution type"
      standard: "Map concept trajectories with evidence, triggers, and classification of evolution type; include genealogies showing ancestor-descendant relationships"
      deep: "Full conceptual lifecycle analysis: all shared concepts tracked with multi-stage trajectories, triggers for each stage, genealogy trees showing how concepts are related across works, and assessment of which trajectories are intellectually productive vs. degenerative"

  - key: dimensional_comparison_matrix
    description: >
      The synthetic view: how do vocabulary, methodology, metaphor, and
      framing changes interact for each concept? A concept may show
      vocabulary continuity but methodological divergence (same word,
      different argument). Or metaphor change but framing stability
      (new imagery, same confidence level). The matrix reveals which
      dimensions are coupled and which are independent -- a key
      diagnostic for understanding the nature of intellectual change.
    probing_questions:
      - "For each key concept, which dimensions changed and which remained stable?"
      - "Are vocabulary changes correlated with methodology changes, or independent?"
      - "Do metaphor shifts predict framing shifts, or are they decoupled?"
      - "Where do all four dimensions change simultaneously -- indicating genuine reconceptualization?"
      - "Where do all four dimensions remain stable -- indicating true intellectual continuity?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Summarize which dimensions changed most across all concepts"
      standard: "Per-concept matrix showing change/stability across all four dimensions with brief evidence; identify patterns of coupling and decoupling"
      deep: "Full dimensional matrix: every concept scored across all dimensions, coupling analysis, identification of change archetypes (e.g., 'vocabulary-led change', 'methodology-led change', 'metaphor-first reconceptualization'), and assessment of what the coupling patterns reveal about the author's intellectual process"
