  In any extended work, chapters are functional units in an argumentative
  edifice. Each plays a specific role — establishing premises, advancing
  claims, handling objections, synthesizing threads. Understanding these
  roles and dependencies is essential for any serious engagement with
  book-length arguments.

  Most reading treats chapters as containers for content — "Chapter 3 is
  about X." But chapters are not containers; they are INSTRUMENTS. Chapter 3
  doesn't just contain claims about X — it DOES something with those claims:
  establishes a foundation for Chapter 4, handles an objection raised
  implicitly in Chapter 2, provides the evidence needed for the conclusion
  in Chapter 7. The chapter's content matters less than its FUNCTION in the
  overall argumentative architecture.

  This functional perspective reveals structural features invisible to
  content-level reading: which chapters are load-bearing (remove them and
  the argument collapses), which are peripheral (they enrich but aren't
  essential), where tight coupling between chapters creates fragility, where
  loose coupling allows reordering. It also reveals vulnerabilities: missing
  bridges between chapters, circular dependencies, orphaned argumentative
  threads that are introduced but never resolved.

  For genealogical analysis specifically, chapter-level functional mapping
  is essential because intellectual influence often operates at the chapter
  level — an author might borrow a framework from one source for one chapter
  and a methodology from another source for a different chapter. Without
  understanding chapter functions, these differential debts remain invisible.

researcher_question: What role does each chapter play in the overall argument, and how do chapters depend on and enable each other?

intellectual_lineage:
  primary:
    name: toulmin
    description: Stephen Toulmin (1922-2009), whose model of practical argument provides the foundation for analyzing the functional structure of extended arguments — understanding chapters as units that provide claims, grounds, warrants, backing, or rebuttals within the larger argumentative architecture.
  secondary:
    - name: van_eemeren
      description: Frans van Eemeren (1946-), Dutch argumentation theorist whose pragma-dialectical approach provides tools for analyzing how argumentative units function within extended discourse, including how stages of discussion (opening, argumentation, concluding) map onto the structure of academic texts.
    - name: perelman
      description: Chaïm Perelman (1912-1984), whose analysis of the strategic arrangement of arguments in extended discourse — where to place strong vs. weak arguments, how to sequence for maximum persuasive effect — directly informs understanding chapter ordering as a strategic choice.
    - name: walton
      description: Douglas Walton (1942-2020), Canadian logician whose work on argumentation schemes and dialogue types provides tools for classifying the type of argumentative work each chapter performs — whether it advances a position, responds to objections, shifts the burden of proof, or establishes common ground.
  traditions:
    - name: argumentation_theory
      description: The interdisciplinary study of how arguments are constructed, evaluated, and deployed in extended discourse, providing tools for analyzing both the internal structure of individual arguments and the macro-structure of argumentative texts.
    - name: structural_analysis
      description: The analytical tradition of examining how parts relate to wholes in complex systems — applicable to understanding how chapters function as structural components of an argumentative edifice.
    - name: dependency_analysis
      description: The practice of mapping how components depend on each other in complex systems, revealing critical paths, single points of failure, and structural vulnerabilities — adapted here for analyzing inter-chapter dependencies in extended arguments.
  key_concepts:
    - name: argumentative_weight
      definition: The differential importance of different chapters to the overall argument — some are load-bearing (remove them and the argument collapses), others are supporting (they enrich but the argument survives without them), others are transitional (they bridge but could be restructured).
    - name: chapter_coupling
      definition: The degree of interdependence between chapters — tightly coupled chapters cannot be understood in isolation, while loosely coupled chapters could be reordered without significant loss. The pattern of coupling reveals the argument's structural architecture.
    - name: structural_vulnerability
      definition: A weak point in the argumentative architecture — a load-bearing chapter that is underdeveloped, a missing bridge between sections, a circular dependency that undermines the logical flow, or an orphaned thread that is introduced but never resolved.
    - name: concept_flow
      definition: The trajectory of key concepts across chapters — where they are introduced, where they are first used significantly, and where they do their heaviest analytical work. Concept flow reveals the argument's developmental logic.
