# THE WHAT: Rich Intellectual Description
# ============================================================

problematique: |
  Not all concepts in a body of work do the same job. Some serve as
  foundations -- they establish the premises on which everything else
  rests. Others elaborate -- they develop implications, extend scope,
  or fill in detail. Still others are defensive -- they anticipate
  and respond to objections, shoring up vulnerabilities. Bridge
  concepts connect domains that would otherwise remain separate,
  enabling cross-pollination. And culminative concepts bring threads
  together into conclusions, the endpoints of argumentative arcs.

  This engine takes the evolution timelines and synthesis output from
  concept_synthesis and asks: what ARGUMENTATIVE WORK does each
  conceptual chain do? It classifies every significant chain into
  one or more functional categories: foundational, elaborative,
  defensive, bridge, or culminative. But it goes beyond mere
  classification. It maps the ARGUMENTATIVE ARCHITECTURE -- how
  chains compose into larger argumentative structures, which chains
  bear the most structural load, where redundancy exists (multiple
  chains doing the same argumentative work), and where the argument
  is most vulnerable (chains doing critical work with weak support).

  The key insight is Toulmin's: arguments are not just claims and
  evidence but complex structures with warrants, backing, qualifiers,
  and rebuttals. Each conceptual chain plays a specific role in this
  structure. Understanding WHICH role reveals the argument's
  engineering -- its load-bearing members, its redundancies, its
  points of failure. An author may not consciously design this
  architecture, but it is there, and making it visible exposes both
  the argument's strengths and its structural weaknesses.

analytical_dimensions:

  - key: functional_classification
    description: >
      Classifying each significant conceptual chain by its argumentative
      function. A chain may serve multiple functions across different works
      or even within a single work. The five primary functions are:
      foundational (establishing premises, grounding the argument),
      elaborative (developing implications, extending scope, adding detail),
      defensive (responding to objections, shoring up vulnerabilities),
      bridge (connecting otherwise separate domains or sub-arguments),
      and culminative (drawing conclusions, reaching endpoints of
      argumentative arcs). Each classification must cite specific textual
      evidence for the assigned function.
    probing_questions:
      - "For each conceptual chain, what argumentative job does it primarily do?"
      - "Does the chain serve different functions in different works or contexts?"
      - "What textual evidence supports this functional classification?"
      - "Are there chains whose function is ambiguous or contested?"
      - "Has the chain's argumentative function shifted over the author's career?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Classify the 5-7 most significant chains with brief functional labels and one-line evidence"
      standard: "Full classification of all significant chains with primary and secondary functions, textual evidence, function-shift tracking across works, and confidence ratings"
      deep: "Comprehensive functional analysis: every chain classified with multi-layered function assessment, diachronic function tracking (how argumentative role changed over the author's career), assessment of whether the author is aware of each chain's actual function, and comparison of stated vs actual argumentative roles"

  - key: argumentative_architecture
    description: >
      How the functionally classified chains compose into larger
      argumentative structures. This is the macroscopic view -- not
      just what each chain does, but how they fit together. Which
      foundational chains support which elaborative chains? Which
      defensive chains protect which claims? Which bridges enable
      which connections? The architecture reveals the argument's
      engineering: its hierarchies, its bottlenecks, its redundancies,
      and its overall structural logic.
    probing_questions:
      - "How do foundational chains connect to the elaborative and culminative chains they support?"
      - "What is the hierarchical structure -- which chains depend on which?"
      - "Are there bottleneck chains where the entire argument flows through a single point?"
      - "What is the overall structural logic -- linear, branching, converging, cyclic?"
      - "How does the architecture change between the author's earlier and later works?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Sketch the main architectural connections between the 3-5 most important chains"
      standard: "Map the full argumentative architecture showing dependencies, hierarchies, bottlenecks, and structural logic across the corpus"
      deep: "Complete architectural analysis: full dependency graph, structural logic classification, diachronic architecture evolution, comparison of the author's explicit argument structure with the implicit architecture revealed by functional analysis, and identification of where the architecture is most elegant and where it is most kludgy"

  - key: load_bearing_analysis
    description: >
      Which conceptual chains are structurally essential -- if removed,
      the argument collapses? Load-bearing chains may not be the most
      prominent or the most discussed; sometimes the most critical
      structural member is an unexamined assumption or a quiet bridge
      concept. This analysis identifies which chains carry the most
      argumentative weight and assesses whether that weight is
      proportional to the evidential support they receive.
    probing_questions:
      - "Which chains, if removed, would cause the most structural damage to the argument?"
      - "Is the load distribution proportional -- do heavily loaded chains receive proportional support?"
      - "Are there load-bearing chains that the author treats as obvious or uncontroversial?"
      - "What is the relationship between a chain's prominence in the text and its structural importance?"
      - "Are there single points of failure -- chains where the entire argument depends on one contested premise?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Identify the 2-3 most structurally critical chains and note their support level"
      standard: "Full load analysis: all load-bearing chains ranked by structural importance, support proportionality assessment, single points of failure, and prominence vs importance comparison"
      deep: "Complete structural engineering analysis: load distribution map, stress testing (what happens if each load-bearing chain is weakened), support deficit identification (where critical chains lack adequate backing), comparison of the author's perceived vs actual load-bearing structure, and recommendations for structural reinforcement"

  - key: redundancy_map
    description: >
      Where do multiple conceptual chains do the same argumentative work?
      Redundancy is not necessarily a flaw -- in engineering, redundancy
      provides resilience. But in argumentation, unintended redundancy
      may indicate confusion, while intentional redundancy may indicate
      strategic reinforcement. This dimension maps overlapping argumentative
      functions and assesses whether the redundancy is productive (providing
      alternative routes to the same conclusion) or wasteful (repeating
      the same work without adding value).
    probing_questions:
      - "Which chains perform overlapping argumentative functions?"
      - "Is the redundancy intentional (strategic reinforcement) or accidental (conceptual confusion)?"
      - "Does the redundancy add resilience or just complexity?"
      - "Are there argumentative functions that have NO redundancy -- single-thread dependencies?"
      - "Has redundancy increased or decreased across the author's career?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Note the most obvious redundancies and single-thread dependencies"
      standard: "Map all significant redundancies and gaps, assess intentionality, and compare redundancy levels across argumentative functions"
      deep: "Full redundancy audit: complete overlap map, intentionality assessment for each redundancy, resilience analysis (how the argument survives if redundant chains are removed), historical redundancy trajectory, and comparison with what an optimal argumentative architecture would look like"

  - key: vulnerability_assessment
    description: >
      Where is the argument weakest? This synthesizes the load-bearing
      analysis and redundancy map to identify the points of maximum
      vulnerability. An argument is vulnerable where: load-bearing chains
      lack adequate support, single-thread dependencies have no redundancy,
      defensive chains are weak or absent where they are most needed, and
      bridge concepts do unacknowledged heavy lifting. The vulnerability
      assessment is not a hostile critique but a structural diagnosis --
      understanding where an argument is vulnerable is the first step
      toward strengthening it.
    probing_questions:
      - "Where does the argument have the least structural support for the most critical claims?"
      - "Which defensive chains are weakest relative to the objections they face?"
      - "Where are bridge concepts doing unacknowledged heavy lifting?"
      - "What are the most likely points of failure under critical examination?"
      - "How would a sophisticated interlocutor attack this argument, and where would it break?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Identify the 2-3 most significant vulnerabilities"
      standard: "Map all significant vulnerabilities with severity ratings, attack vectors, and assessment of how the author could address them"
      deep: "Complete vulnerability assessment: all weak points mapped with severity and exploitability ratings, simulated adversarial attacks, recommendations for structural reinforcement, comparison of vulnerabilities across the author's career (are they getting better or worse at structural defense?), and assessment of whether some vulnerabilities are productive (enabling flexibility) vs dangerous (threatening collapse)"
