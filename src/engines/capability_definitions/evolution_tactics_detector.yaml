# THE WHAT: Rich Intellectual Description
# ============================================================

problematique: |
  When authors write across many years, they inevitably change their
  minds. But they rarely just SAY "I changed my mind." Instead, they
  employ a repertoire of intellectual self-management tactics --
  strategies for handling the relationship between what they said before
  and what they say now. These tactics are not necessarily dishonest;
  they are often unconscious, sometimes strategic, and always revealing.

  This engine detects 10 recurring tactics:

  CONCEPTUAL RECYCLING: Reusing old arguments in new frameworks where
  they serve different functions -- same building materials, different
  building. SILENT REVISION: Changing position without acknowledgment,
  writing as if the new view was always held. STRATEGIC ESCALATION:
  Promoting tentative prior claims to established facts without new
  evidence. FRAMEWORK MIGRATION: Moving concepts between theoretical
  homes without justifying the transplant. STRATEGIC AMNESIA:
  Selectively forgetting inconvenient prior commitments. VOCABULARY
  LAUNDERING: Renaming concepts to shed unwanted associations -- the
  same idea reappears under a new name, severed from its problematic
  history. AUTHORITY BOOTSTRAPPING: Leveraging credibility earned from
  careful prior work to legitimize current speculative claims.
  HEDGING RECLASSIFICATION: Retroactively qualifying past claims as
  more tentative than they actually were, creating room for the current
  position. COMPLEXITY SHIELDING: Burying contradictions between prior
  and current positions in layers of complexity so they are difficult
  to detect. LEGACY MANAGEMENT: Actively curating one's intellectual
  history -- selectively citing earlier work, reframing past positions,
  constructing a narrative of purposeful development where the actual
  trajectory was more reactive.

  The analytical stance is Goffman's: we are watching impression
  management applied to intellectual identity. The author is performing
  a self that has a coherent intellectual history, and the tactics are
  the dramaturgical techniques of that performance. Bourdieu adds the
  dimension of cultural capital -- these tactics are strategies for
  maintaining and deploying accumulated intellectual credibility.
  Kuhn provides the framework for understanding why tactics cluster
  around certain moments: paradigm shifts within an author's own work
  create the most intense need for self-management.

  Every detection must be VERIFIABLE -- grounded in specific vocabulary
  evidence, framing evidence, and methodological evidence from both
  earlier and later works. The engine does not make impressionistic
  judgments; it builds evidence-based cases for each tactic instance.

# ANALYTICAL DIMENSIONS: Directions of Inquiry
# ============================================================

analytical_dimensions:

  - key: tactic_detection
    description: >
      Identifying specific tactic instances with full evidence chains.
      Each detection specifies: which tactic from the taxonomy, the
      source work (earlier position with quotes), the target work (current
      position with quotes), vocabulary evidence (how word choice supports
      the detection), framing evidence (how presentation changes support
      the detection), methodological evidence (how method continuity or
      change supports the detection), confidence level, and severity.
      The detection must be VERIFIABLE -- a reader given the evidence
      should be able to confirm or dispute the finding.
    probing_questions:
      - "For each pair of works, what position shifts occurred and how were they managed?"
      - "Where has tentative language been replaced by definitive language without new evidence (strategic escalation)?"
      - "Where has the author contradicted a prior position without acknowledging the contradiction (silent revision)?"
      - "Where are concepts reappearing under new names (vocabulary laundering) or in new frameworks (framework migration)?"
      - "Where are inconvenient prior commitments simply absent from the discussion (strategic amnesia)?"
      - "Where is the author using past credibility to support current speculation (authority bootstrapping)?"
      - "What vocabulary, framing, and methodological evidence supports each detection?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Detect the 3-5 most prominent tactic instances with brief evidence"
      standard: "Systematic detection across all significant position shifts, with full vocabulary/framing/methodological evidence chains, confidence ratings, and severity assessments for each instance"
      deep: "Exhaustive detection: every detectable tactic instance mapped with comprehensive evidence, including borderline cases with explicit reasoning for inclusion/exclusion, comparison of the same tactic across multiple work-pairs, and assessment of the author's tactical sophistication (do tactics become more subtle over time?)"

  - key: tactic_patterns
    description: >
      Moving beyond individual detections to see the patterns. Which
      tactic does the author use most frequently? Which tactics cluster
      together (e.g., narrative bootstrapping + escalation, selective
      continuity + retroactive framing)? What does the overall tactic
      distribution reveal about the author's intellectual management
      style? Some authors are primarily escalators (always amplifying),
      others are primarily revisers (always changing quietly), and
      others are primarily narrators (always constructing coherence
      stories). The pattern is the fingerprint.
    probing_questions:
      - "What is the most frequently used tactic type, and what does that reveal?"
      - "What is the distribution across all 10 tactic types?"
      - "Which tactics cluster together -- appear in the same passages or serve the same strategic purpose?"
      - "What does the overall pattern reveal about the author's intellectual management style?"
      - "Is there a dominant mode: escalation, revision, narration, or amnesia?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Note the most frequent tactic and any obvious clusters"
      standard: "Full distribution analysis, cluster identification with explanation of how clustered tactics reinforce each other, and characterization of the author's overall management style"
      deep: "Comprehensive pattern analysis: full distribution with statistical characterization, all tactic clusters mapped with functional analysis (what each cluster achieves), comparison of the author's tactic profile with common profiles in their field, assessment of whether the tactic repertoire is typical or distinctive, and narrative synthesis of what the pattern reveals about the author's relationship with their own intellectual history"

  - key: tactic_evolution
    description: >
      How the author's tactical repertoire changes over time. Do early
      works show simpler tactics (direct revision) while later works
      show more sophisticated ones (complexity shielding, legacy
      management)? Are there periods of intense tactical activity --
      perhaps corresponding to major intellectual shifts? Does the
      author develop new tactics as their career progresses, or rely
      on the same repertoire throughout? Tactic evolution is itself
      a kind of intellectual evolution, and tracking it reveals how
      the author's self-management capacity develops.
    probing_questions:
      - "How does the tactic repertoire change across the author's career?"
      - "Do tactics become more sophisticated over time?"
      - "Are there periods of intense tactical activity corresponding to intellectual crises?"
      - "Does the author develop new tactics or rely on the same ones throughout?"
      - "Is there a relationship between the magnitude of position change and the sophistication of tactics used to manage it?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Note any obvious shifts in tactic usage between early and late career"
      standard: "Map tactic usage by career period, identify inflection points, and assess whether tactical sophistication increases over time"
      deep: "Full diachronic analysis: tactic usage tracked across all career periods, correlation with intellectual crisis points, sophistication trajectory, comparison of early vs late tactical repertoire, and assessment of whether the author has become more or less self-aware about their own tactics"

  - key: tactic_effectiveness
    description: >
      How well does each tactic actually work? A silent revision may
      go unnoticed by most readers but be transparent to specialists.
      A strategic escalation may be effective in popular writing but
      fail in peer review. Vocabulary laundering may succeed when
      the author has moved to a new audience but fail when the same
      readers follow both old and new work. Effectiveness depends on
      audience, context, and the quality of execution. Some authors
      are gifted tacticians; others are clumsy and transparent.
    probing_questions:
      - "For each detected tactic, how likely is it to succeed with the intended audience?"
      - "Are there tactics that work well in one context but fail in another?"
      - "Does the author execute tactics skillfully or clumsily?"
      - "Have any of the author's tactics been publicly called out by critics?"
      - "What makes certain tactic instances more effective than others?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "Brief assessment of effectiveness for the most prominent tactics"
      standard: "Effectiveness rating for each detected tactic instance, with analysis of what makes some more effective than others and how audience/context affects success"
      deep: "Full effectiveness analysis: each instance rated for execution quality, audience-relative effectiveness, transparency to different reader types, comparison of intended vs actual effect, and assessment of the author's overall tactical skill level"

  - key: tactic_taxonomy
    description: >
      The complete classification system for all detected tactics.
      While the 10 core types provide the initial framework, real
      intellectual behavior sometimes produces hybrid tactics, novel
      tactics that don't fit the taxonomy, or variants that refine
      the categories. This dimension captures the full taxonomy as
      instantiated in this author's work, including any extensions
      or modifications needed to accommodate what was actually found.
    probing_questions:
      - "Do all detected tactics fit cleanly into the 10 core types?"
      - "Are there hybrid tactics -- combinations of two or more types?"
      - "Are there novel tactics this author employs that the taxonomy doesn't capture?"
      - "Which taxonomy categories are instantiated and which are absent?"
      - "Does this author's tactical repertoire suggest refinements to the taxonomy itself?"
    depth_guidance:
      surface: "List which taxonomy categories are present and absent"
      standard: "Full taxonomy instantiation with notes on any hybrids, gaps, and potential extensions"
      deep: "Complete taxonomic analysis: every category assessed for fit, all hybrids and novel tactics documented with proposed classifications, taxonomy coverage analysis, and reflexive assessment of whether this author's practice reveals limitations in the taxonomy that should be addressed"
