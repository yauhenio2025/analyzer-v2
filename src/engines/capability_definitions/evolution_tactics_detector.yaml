  When authors write across many years, they inevitably change their
  minds. But they rarely just SAY "I changed my mind." Instead, they
  employ a repertoire of intellectual self-management tactics --
  strategies for handling the relationship between what they said before
  and what they say now. These tactics are not necessarily dishonest;
  they are often unconscious, sometimes strategic, and always revealing.

  This engine detects 10 recurring tactics:

  CONCEPTUAL RECYCLING: Reusing old arguments in new frameworks where
  they serve different functions -- same building materials, different
  building. SILENT REVISION: Changing position without acknowledgment,
  writing as if the new view was always held. STRATEGIC ESCALATION:
  Promoting tentative prior claims to established facts without new
  evidence. FRAMEWORK MIGRATION: Moving concepts between theoretical
  homes without justifying the transplant. STRATEGIC AMNESIA:
  Selectively forgetting inconvenient prior commitments. VOCABULARY
  LAUNDERING: Renaming concepts to shed unwanted associations -- the
  same idea reappears under a new name, severed from its problematic
  history. AUTHORITY BOOTSTRAPPING: Leveraging credibility earned from
  careful prior work to legitimize current speculative claims.
  HEDGING RECLASSIFICATION: Retroactively qualifying past claims as
  more tentative than they actually were, creating room for the current
  position. COMPLEXITY SHIELDING: Burying contradictions between prior
  and current positions in layers of complexity so they are difficult
  to detect. LEGACY MANAGEMENT: Actively curating one's intellectual
  history -- selectively citing earlier work, reframing past positions,
  constructing a narrative of purposeful development where the actual
  trajectory was more reactive.

  The analytical stance is Goffman's: we are watching impression
  management applied to intellectual identity. The author is performing
  a self that has a coherent intellectual history, and the tactics are
  the dramaturgical techniques of that performance. Bourdieu adds the
  dimension of cultural capital -- these tactics are strategies for
  maintaining and deploying accumulated intellectual credibility.
  Kuhn provides the framework for understanding why tactics cluster
  around certain moments: paradigm shifts within an author's own work
  create the most intense need for self-management.

  Every detection must be VERIFIABLE -- grounded in specific vocabulary
  evidence, framing evidence, and methodological evidence from both
  earlier and later works. The engine does not make impressionistic
  judgments; it builds evidence-based cases for each tactic instance.
researcher_question: What tactics does this author use to manage the relationship between their prior
  and current work?
intellectual_lineage:
  primary:
    name: goffman
    description: 'Erving Goffman (1922-1982), Canadian-American sociologist who pioneered the dramaturgical
      analysis of social life, examining how individuals perform and manage their public identities through
      strategic self-presentation. His framework is primary here because intellectual self-management
      across time is fundamentally a problem of impression management: authors must construct and maintain
      a coherent intellectual persona even as their actual positions shift, employing tactics that preserve
      face and credibility before their audience of readers and peers.'
  secondary:
  - name: bourdieu
    description: 'Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002), French sociologist and anthropologist who theorized how
      cultural capital operates as a form of power in intellectual and artistic fields. His framework
      adds to Goffman''s dramaturgical lens by explaining what is at stake in intellectual self-management:
      accumulated credibility and authority that must be preserved, deployed strategically, and protected
      from devaluation when positions change—these tactics are moves in a competitive field where symbolic
      capital is the currency.'
  - name: kuhn
    description: Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996), American physicist and philosopher of science whose analysis
      of paradigm shifts and scientific revolutions explains why intellectual self-management tactics
      intensify at certain moments. His framework helps this engine understand that authors experience
      internal paradigm shifts—moments when their own conceptual frameworks reorganize—and these transitions
      create the most acute need for retrospective coherence-building and tactical relationship management
      with prior work.
  - name: lakatos
    description: Imre Lakatos (1922-1974), Hungarian philosopher of mathematics and science who developed
      the methodology of research programmes, emphasizing how scientists protect theoretical cores through
      strategic auxiliary hypotheses and problem-shift management. His work informs this engine's understanding
      of how authors construct protective belts around their evolving positions, using tactics to shield
      core commitments while allowing peripheral elements to shift—intellectual self-management as progressive
      versus degenerative programme management.
  traditions:
  - name: dramaturgical_sociology
    description: 'A sociological approach treating social interaction as theatrical performance, where
      individuals strategically manage impressions through front-stage presentations while backstage realities
      may differ. This tradition provides the engine''s fundamental analytical stance: viewing intellectual
      production as performance before audiences, where maintaining character consistency across time
      requires dramaturgical skill, and detecting the tactics authors use to sustain their performed intellectual
      identity despite position changes.'
  - name: field_theory
    description: Bourdieu's analytical framework examining how social spaces operate as competitive fields
      where agents struggle for position and capital accumulation according to field-specific rules and
      stakes. This tradition informs the engine's understanding that intellectual self-management occurs
      within a structured competitive space where credibility and authority are scarce resources, making
      tactics not merely psychological but strategic responses to field pressures and the imperative to
      maintain position.
  - name: philosophy_of_science
    description: The disciplinary tradition examining the logic, methods, and dynamics of scientific knowledge
      production, including how theories develop, compete, and succeed or fail over time. This tradition
      provides the engine with frameworks for understanding intellectual change itself—distinguishing
      progressive from degenerative shifts, recognizing paradigmatic transitions, and identifying the
      methodological commitments that structure how authors justify their evolving positions.
  - name: rhetoric_of_science
    description: An interdisciplinary tradition analyzing scientific discourse as persuasive communication,
      examining how scientists use rhetorical strategies to establish credibility, construct facts, and
      manage controversy. This tradition sensitizes the engine to the textual and linguistic evidence
      of tactical self-management—how vocabulary choices, hedging patterns, citation practices, and framing
      devices reveal authors' strategic work to position current claims relative to prior commitments.
  - name: intellectual_history
    description: 'The historical study of ideas and thinkers across time, examining how concepts develop,
      migrate between contexts, and how individual intellectuals'' thought evolves through engagement
      with predecessors and contemporaries. This tradition provides the engine with methodology for diachronic
      analysis: comparing texts across career spans, tracking conceptual transformations, and recognizing
      that intellectual development is rarely linear but involves complex negotiations between continuity
      and rupture that require tactical management.'
  key_concepts:
  - name: impression_management
    definition: The strategic control of information and performance that individuals use to shape how
      others perceive them. For this engine, it names the overarching process authors engage in when managing
      their intellectual identity across time—using specific tactics to control how readers perceive the
      relationship between earlier and current work, preserving an impression of coherence, rigor, and
      purposeful development.
  - name: face_work
    definition: 'The communicative actions taken to maintain one''s positive social value and avoid embarrassment
      or loss of credibility when interactions threaten it. The engine uses this to understand why certain
      tactics appear: authors employ them as face-saving moves when position changes might otherwise create
      vulnerability to charges of inconsistency, error, or intellectual opportunism.'
  - name: cultural_capital
    definition: 'Accumulated prestige, credentials, knowledge, and authority that function as assets in
      intellectual and cultural fields, enabling influence and access to further resources. This concept
      explains what authors protect through their self-management tactics: the credibility capital earned
      through prior work that could be devalued if position changes appear arbitrary or unprincipled rather
      than as legitimate intellectual evolution.'
  - name: habitus
    definition: The durable, transposable dispositions and unconscious schemas that structure how individuals
      perceive, evaluate, and act in social fields. For this engine, habitus explains why many self-management
      tactics operate below conscious awareness—they reflect deeply internalized disciplinary and professional
      dispositions about what constitutes legitimate intellectual conduct and how position changes must
      be handled to preserve standing.
  - name: paradigm_shift
    definition: A fundamental reorganization of the conceptual framework, methods, and problem definitions
      that structure inquiry within a domain. The engine uses this to identify moments when authors undergo
      internal paradigm shifts—major theoretical reorientations that create the most acute need for retrospective
      relationship management with prior work that was produced under different conceptual commitments.
  - name: research_programme
    definition: Lakatos's term for a structured sequence of theories sharing a protected hard core of
      commitments surrounded by a flexible protective belt of auxiliary hypotheses that can be modified
      without abandoning the core. This concept helps the engine distinguish tactical maneuvers that defend
      core intellectual commitments (legitimate programme development) from those that obscure genuine
      core changes (degenerative tactical management).
  - name: performative_coherence
    definition: 'The achieved appearance of intellectual consistency and purposeful development constructed
      through textual and rhetorical performance rather than reflecting actual linear progression. This
      names what authors create through successful self-management tactics: a performed narrative of coherent
      evolution that papers over actual discontinuities, opportunistic pivots, and reactive position changes.'
  - name: strategic_self_presentation
    definition: The deliberate crafting of one's public identity and biographical narrative to achieve
      specific goals or maintain desired impressions. For this engine, it encompasses the full range of
      tactics authors use to present their intellectual trajectory as principled, progressive, and coherent—actively
      constructing the relationship between past and present work rather than simply reporting it.
analytical_dimensions:
- key: tactic_detection
  description: |
    Identifying specific tactic instances with full evidence chains. Each detection specifies: which tactic from the taxonomy, the source work (earlier position with quotes), the target work (current position with quotes), vocabulary evidence (how word choice supports the detection), framing evidence (how presentation changes support the detection), methodological evidence (how method continuity or change supports the detection), confidence level, and severity. The detection must be VERIFIABLE -- a reader given the evidence should be able to confirm or dispute the finding.
  probing_questions:
  - For each pair of works, what position shifts occurred and how were they managed?
  - Where has tentative language been replaced by definitive language without new evidence (strategic
    escalation)?
  - Where has the author contradicted a prior position without acknowledging the contradiction (silent
    revision)?
  - Where are concepts reappearing under new names (vocabulary laundering) or in new frameworks (framework
    migration)?
  - Where are inconvenient prior commitments simply absent from the discussion (strategic amnesia)?
  - Where is the author using past credibility to support current speculation (authority bootstrapping)?
  - What vocabulary, framing, and methodological evidence supports each detection?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Detect the 3-5 most prominent tactic instances with brief evidence
    standard: Systematic detection across all significant position shifts, with full vocabulary/framing/methodological
      evidence chains, confidence ratings, and severity assessments for each instance
    deep: 'Exhaustive detection: every detectable tactic instance mapped with comprehensive evidence,
      including borderline cases with explicit reasoning for inclusion/exclusion, comparison of the same
      tactic across multiple work-pairs, and assessment of the author''s tactical sophistication (do tactics
      become more subtle over time?)'
- key: tactic_patterns
  description: |
    Moving beyond individual detections to see the patterns. Which tactic does the author use most frequently? Which tactics cluster together (e.g., narrative bootstrapping + escalation, selective continuity + retroactive framing)? What does the overall tactic distribution reveal about the author's intellectual management style? Some authors are primarily escalators (always amplifying), others are primarily revisers (always changing quietly), and others are primarily narrators (always constructing coherence stories). The pattern is the fingerprint.
  probing_questions:
  - What is the most frequently used tactic type, and what does that reveal?
  - What is the distribution across all 10 tactic types?
  - Which tactics cluster together -- appear in the same passages or serve the same strategic purpose?
  - What does the overall pattern reveal about the author's intellectual management style?
  - 'Is there a dominant mode: escalation, revision, narration, or amnesia?'
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note the most frequent tactic and any obvious clusters
    standard: Full distribution analysis, cluster identification with explanation of how clustered tactics
      reinforce each other, and characterization of the author's overall management style
    deep: 'Comprehensive pattern analysis: full distribution with statistical characterization, all tactic
      clusters mapped with functional analysis (what each cluster achieves), comparison of the author''s
      tactic profile with common profiles in their field, assessment of whether the tactic repertoire
      is typical or distinctive, and narrative synthesis of what the pattern reveals about the author''s
      relationship with their own intellectual history'
- key: tactic_evolution
  description: |
    How the author's tactical repertoire changes over time. Do early works show simpler tactics (direct revision) while later works show more sophisticated ones (complexity shielding, legacy management)? Are there periods of intense tactical activity -- perhaps corresponding to major intellectual shifts? Does the author develop new tactics as their career progresses, or rely on the same repertoire throughout? Tactic evolution is itself a kind of intellectual evolution, and tracking it reveals how the author's self-management capacity develops.
  probing_questions:
  - How does the tactic repertoire change across the author's career?
  - Do tactics become more sophisticated over time?
  - Are there periods of intense tactical activity corresponding to intellectual crises?
  - Does the author develop new tactics or rely on the same ones throughout?
  - Is there a relationship between the magnitude of position change and the sophistication of tactics
    used to manage it?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note any obvious shifts in tactic usage between early and late career
    standard: Map tactic usage by career period, identify inflection points, and assess whether tactical
      sophistication increases over time
    deep: 'Full diachronic analysis: tactic usage tracked across all career periods, correlation with
      intellectual crisis points, sophistication trajectory, comparison of early vs late tactical repertoire,
      and assessment of whether the author has become more or less self-aware about their own tactics'
- key: tactic_effectiveness
  description: |
    How well does each tactic actually work? A silent revision may go unnoticed by most readers but be transparent to specialists. A strategic escalation may be effective in popular writing but fail in peer review. Vocabulary laundering may succeed when the author has moved to a new audience but fail when the same readers follow both old and new work. Effectiveness depends on audience, context, and the quality of execution. Some authors are gifted tacticians; others are clumsy and transparent.
  probing_questions:
  - For each detected tactic, how likely is it to succeed with the intended audience?
  - Are there tactics that work well in one context but fail in another?
  - Does the author execute tactics skillfully or clumsily?
  - Have any of the author's tactics been publicly called out by critics?
  - What makes certain tactic instances more effective than others?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Brief assessment of effectiveness for the most prominent tactics
    standard: Effectiveness rating for each detected tactic instance, with analysis of what makes some
      more effective than others and how audience/context affects success
    deep: 'Full effectiveness analysis: each instance rated for execution quality, audience-relative effectiveness,
      transparency to different reader types, comparison of intended vs actual effect, and assessment
      of the author''s overall tactical skill level'
- key: tactic_taxonomy
  description: |
    The complete classification system for all detected tactics. While the 10 core types provide the initial framework, real intellectual behavior sometimes produces hybrid tactics, novel tactics that don't fit the taxonomy, or variants that refine the categories. This dimension captures the full taxonomy as instantiated in this author's work, including any extensions or modifications needed to accommodate what was actually found.
  probing_questions:
  - Do all detected tactics fit cleanly into the 10 core types?
  - Are there hybrid tactics -- combinations of two or more types?
  - Are there novel tactics this author employs that the taxonomy doesn't capture?
  - Which taxonomy categories are instantiated and which are absent?
  - Does this author's tactical repertoire suggest refinements to the taxonomy itself?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: List which taxonomy categories are present and absent
    standard: Full taxonomy instantiation with notes on any hybrids, gaps, and potential extensions
    deep: 'Complete taxonomic analysis: every category assessed for fit, all hybrids and novel tactics
      documented with proposed classifications, taxonomy coverage analysis, and reflexive assessment of
      whether this author''s practice reveals limitations in the taxonomy that should be addressed'

- key: detect_tactics
  description: Identify specific tactic instances with verifiable evidence chains across vocabulary, framing,
    and methodology
  produces_dimensions:
  - tactic_detection
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability performs the foundational work of identifying specific instances where an author manages the relationship between their prior and current positions using one of the ten tactical repertoires. Drawing on Goffman's dramaturgical sociology, it treats each tactic instance as a moment of intellectual face-work—where the author performs coherence while navigating actual discontinuity. The detection must be verifiable: for each instance, it establishes an evidence chain across three domains (vocabulary, framing, methodology), locates the source position in earlier work and target position in current work, and assesses confidence and severity. This is not impressionistic criticism but forensic analysis—building cases that can be confirmed or disputed by returning to the texts.

    This capability feeds all others in the engine: without specific tactic detections, there can be no pattern analysis, no evolution tracking, no effectiveness assessment. It transforms the vague sense that "the author changed their mind" into a structured catalog of how that change was managed rhetorically. The capability must distinguish between legitimate intellectual development (acknowledged, justified) and tactical management (unacknowledged, compensatory). A naive version simply spots contradictions; a sophisticated version recognizes that the same contradiction can be managed through multiple tactics simultaneously (e.g., vocabulary laundering + strategic amnesia), understands that absence of acknowledgment is itself evidence, and tracks how methodological continuity can mask conceptual migration.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: goffman
    concept: impression_management
    method: Following Goffman's analysis of self-presentation, this capability treats intellectual work
      as a performance requiring consistency maintenance. It identifies the 'front stage' (public position)
      versus 'back stage' (actual position shift) discrepancies, examining the dramaturgical techniques
      authors use to manage potentially discrediting information about their intellectual past.
  indicators:
  - An author makes a strong claim without citation to their own prior tentative work on the same topic
  - Key terms from earlier work are absent when discussing what appears to be the same concept under a
    new name
  - Methodological framing shifts (e.g., from empirical to theoretical) without explicit justification
    for the change
  - The author cites their earlier work selectively, omitting passages that would contradict current position
  - Hedging language in earlier work ('might', 'could', 'tentatively') replaced by definitive language
    ('is', 'demonstrates', 'establishes') without new evidence

      instance
    deep: Exhaustive detection including borderline cases with explicit inclusion/exclusion reasoning,
      tracking of the same tactic across multiple work-pairs, micro-analysis of tactical execution quality,

  description: Identify the distribution, clustering, and overall profile of the author's tactical repertoire
  produces_dimensions:
  - tactic_patterns
  requires_dimensions:
  - tactic_detection
  extended_description: |-
    This capability moves from individual tactical moments to the author's characteristic repertoire—the distinctive profile of how they manage intellectual change. Following Bourdieu's field theory, it recognizes that each author develops a habitus of self-management, a set of dispositions that generate patterned tactical responses to intellectual discontinuity. The analysis produces a distribution across the ten tactic types, identifies which tactics cluster together (revealing strategic combinations), and characterizes the author's overall management style. Some authors are primarily escalators (always amplifying modest claims), others are revisers (quietly changing without acknowledgment), still others are narrators (constructing coherent developmental stories). The pattern is the fingerprint—it reveals not just what an author does, but their characteristic mode of handling the relationship with their own past.

    This capability depends on detect_tactics for raw material but transforms it into a higher-order portrait. It enables downstream assessment of whether an author's tactical repertoire is typical for their field or distinctive, whether it becomes more sophisticated over time, and how it relates to their position in intellectual space. A naive version simply counts tactic frequencies; a sophisticated version recognizes that tactics form functional clusters (framework migration + vocabulary laundering work together to relocate a concept), identifies dominant modes that reveal intellectual temperament, and assesses whether the repertoire shows strategic coherence or opportunistic improvisation.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: bourdieu
    concept: habitus
    method: Applying Bourdieu's concept of habitus to intellectual practice, this capability treats tactic
      patterns as embodied dispositions—not conscious strategies but internalized schemes of intellectual
      self-management. It examines how repeated tactical choices constitute a durable orientation toward
      one's own intellectual history, shaped by field position and accumulated cultural capital.
  indicators:
  - The same tactic type appears across multiple work-pairs separated by years
  - Certain tactics consistently appear together in the same passages or serving the same shift
  - One tactic type dominates the frequency distribution (>40% of instances)
  - Tactical combinations show functional coherence (e.g., amnesia about inconvenient claims + escalation
    of convenient ones)
  - The overall pattern resembles known profiles (the escalator, the quiet reviser, the narrative constructor)
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Most frequent tactic identified with note of any obvious clustering (e.g., 'primarily uses
      strategic escalation, often combined with authority bootstrapping')
    standard: Full distribution analysis across all tactic types, identification of functional clusters
      with explanation of how they reinforce each other, and characterization of overall management style
      with comparison to common profiles
    deep: Comprehensive pattern analysis with statistical characterization of distribution, all tactic
      clusters mapped with functional analysis, comparison to field-typical profiles, assessment of repertoire
      distinctiveness, and narrative synthesis of what the pattern reveals about the author's relationship
      with their intellectual history

  description: Track how the author's tactical repertoire changes across career stages
  produces_dimensions:
  - tactic_evolution
  requires_dimensions:
  - tactic_detection
  - tactic_patterns
  extended_description: |-
    This capability tracks the diachronic development of the author's tactical repertoire across career stages, revealing how their self-management capacity evolves. Drawing on Lakatos's methodology of research programmes, it recognizes that intellectual evolution involves not just changing ideas but changing meta-level strategies for managing change. Early-career tactics may be crude (direct contradiction without acknowledgment), while mature tactics become sophisticated (complexity shielding that buries contradictions in technical apparatus). Periods of intense tactical activity often correspond to paradigm shifts within the author's own work—moments when the relationship between past and present becomes most strained. Tracking this evolution reveals whether an author develops greater tactical sophistication, maintains a stable repertoire, or becomes more transparent and self-aware about their own changes.

    This capability requires tactic_detection as input and tactic_patterns for comparative analysis across periods. It enables assessment of whether tactical sophistication correlates with intellectual crisis points, whether the author becomes more or less transparent over time, and whether new tactics emerge or old ones persist throughout the career. A naive version simply chronologically orders tactic instances; a sophisticated version identifies inflection points where repertoire shifts, correlates tactical intensity with intellectual crisis, assesses whether sophistication increases (suggesting strategic learning) or remains stable (suggesting dispositional consistency), and evaluates whether late-career work shows more self-awareness about intellectual management.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: lakatos
    concept: research_programme
    method: Following Lakatos's analysis of how research programmes evolve through protective belt modifications,
      this capability treats tactic evolution as meta-level programme management. It examines how authors
      develop increasingly sophisticated protective mechanisms around their core commitments, tracking
      whether the tactical repertoire shows progressive (increasingly sophisticated) or degenerating (increasingly
      crude or desperate) evolution.
  indicators:
  - Early works show simple tactics (silent revision, strategic amnesia) while later works show complex
    ones (complexity shielding, legacy management)
  - A cluster of multiple tactic types appears around a specific career inflection point or major work
  - The same tactic type is executed more skillfully in later works than earlier ones
  - New tactics appear in the repertoire that were absent in early career
  - Late-career works explicitly acknowledge and justify position changes that earlier works managed tacitly
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Note of any obvious shifts between early and late career (e.g., 'later works use more sophisticated
      complexity shielding')
    standard: Tactic usage mapped by career period (early/middle/late), inflection points identified,
      and assessment of whether tactical sophistication trajectory is increasing, stable, or decreasing
    deep: Full diachronic analysis tracking tactic usage across all career periods, correlation with intellectual
      crisis points and major position shifts, sophistication trajectory assessment, comparison of early
      versus late tactical repertoire, and evaluation of whether the author has become more or less self-aware

  description: Evaluate how well each tactic works given audience, context, and execution quality
  produces_dimensions:
  - tactic_effectiveness
  requires_dimensions:
  - tactic_detection
  extended_description: |-
    This capability evaluates how well each tactic actually works in context—whether it successfully manages the impression of coherence or fails transparently. Effectiveness depends on multiple factors: audience sophistication (specialists may detect silent revisions that generalists miss), context of use (popular writing versus peer review), and execution quality (skilled versus clumsy deployment). Following Goffman's attention to performance success conditions, this capability assesses whether the face-work succeeds or fails, whether the impression management convinces its intended audience. Some authors are gifted tacticians whose framework migrations seem natural and justified; others are transparent and awkward, producing tactics that call attention to the very discontinuities they attempt to mask. Effectiveness also varies by tactic type: vocabulary laundering may work well when changing audiences but fail when the same readers follow both old and new work.

    This capability depends on tactic_detection for specific instances but adds evaluative assessment of success. It enables identification of which tactics work best for this author, which contexts make tactics more or less effective, and whether the author's overall tactical skill level is high or low. A naive version assumes all detected tactics fail ("caught in contradiction"); a sophisticated version recognizes that many tactics succeed with most readers, evaluates effectiveness relative to intended audience and context, distinguishes execution quality from tactical choice, and identifies cases where tactics have been publicly called out versus cases where they operate successfully below critical radar.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: goffman
    concept: face_work
    method: Following Goffman's analysis of face-work success and failure, this capability examines whether
      each tactical performance maintains the desired impression or produces embarrassment. It assesses
      the conditions under which impression management succeeds (audience alignment, smooth execution)
      versus fails (audience sophistication, clumsy execution, contextual exposure), treating effectiveness
      as situationally determined rather than absolute.
  indicators:
  - Critical reviews or peer responses explicitly identify a tactic (e.g., 'Smith contradicts their earlier
    work without acknowledgment')
  - The same tactic works in popular writing but fails in specialist contexts, or vice versa
  - Execution shows telltale signs of clumsiness (awkward phrasing, over-emphasis, defensive hedging)
  - Evidence that different reader populations respond differently to the same tactic
  - The author themselves later acknowledge or correct a tactic, suggesting it failed to achieve desired
    effect

  - tactic_patterns
  extended_description: |-
    This capability maps the engine's ten-type taxonomy onto the author's actual tactical behavior, determining which categories are instantiated, which are absent, and whether the author's practice reveals hybrids, novel tactics, or gaps that suggest taxonomy refinement. The taxonomy is a theoretical framework; instantiation tests it against empirical reality. Some authors use all ten types; others have a narrow repertoire. Some produce clear exemplars of each type; others generate hybrid tactics that combine features (e.g., vocabulary laundering + framework migration executed simultaneously). Following Kuhn's attention to paradigm structure and fit, this capability assesses whether the taxonomy's categories capture what the author actually does or whether they produce recalcitrant cases that resist classification. It also reflexively evaluates whether this author's practice reveals limitations in the taxonomy itself.

    This capability depends on tactic_detection for raw instances and tactic_patterns for distribution data. It produces a comprehensive taxonomic map showing which categories are present/absent, how well each category fits (clean exemplars versus forced classifications), and what extensions or refinements the author's behavior suggests. A naive version simply checks boxes for present/absent categories; a sophisticated version assesses quality of fit for each instance (prototypical, borderline, hybrid), documents novel tactics that escape the taxonomy, proposes refined categories or new types when warranted, and reflexively evaluates whether the author's practice reveals that the taxonomy overdraws distinctions (two categories that are actually one) or underdraws them (one category that should be split).
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: kuhn
    concept: paradigm_articulation
    method: Following Kuhn's account of how paradigms are articulated through puzzle-solving that tests
      and refines exemplars, this capability treats taxonomy instantiation as an empirical test of theoretical
      categories. It examines how well the ten-type framework accommodates actual tactical behavior, identifying
      where the taxonomy needs articulation (refinement of boundaries) versus where it encounters genuine
      anomalies that resist assimilation.
  indicators:
  - A detected tactic instance shows features of multiple taxonomy categories simultaneously
  - An author's behavior seems tactical but doesn't fit cleanly into any of the ten types
  - Two supposedly distinct tactic types always appear together and may be aspects of one phenomenon
  - A taxonomy category is never instantiated across dozens of potential instances
  - Forced classifications where the analyst struggles to justify category assignment
  depth_scaling:
    surface: List of which taxonomy categories are present versus absent in the author's work
    standard: Full taxonomy instantiation showing present/absent categories, documentation of any hybrid
      tactics or boundary cases, and notes on potential extensions or refinements suggested by this author's
      practice
    deep: Complete taxonomic analysis with fit assessment for every instance (prototypical/borderline/hybrid),
      documentation of all novel tactics with proposed classifications, analysis of taxonomy coverage
      and gaps, proposals for category refinements or additions, and reflexive evaluation of whether this
      author's practice reveals structural limitations in the taxonomy that should be addressed
