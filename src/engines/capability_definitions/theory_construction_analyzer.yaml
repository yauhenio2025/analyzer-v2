  Theories do not arrive fully formed from the heavens. They are constructed — assembled piece by piece through specific intellectual moves, borrowings, translations, and justifications. Yet most readers encounter theories as finished products, evaluating whether they agree with the conclusions while remaining blind to how the theoretical edifice was built. This blindness matters because the construction process encodes commitments, constraints, and vulnerabilities that determine what the theory can and cannot do. A theory bootstrapped from biological metaphors carries hidden organicist assumptions. A theory synthesized from incompatible paradigms may contain fault lines invisible until stressed. A theory that sacrifices parsimony for explanatory power may collapse under its own complexity. Understanding how a theory was built is prerequisite to understanding what it really claims.

  Most authors construct theories unreflectively, inheriting paradigmatic assumptions they never examine, borrowing concepts without acknowledging what distorts in translation, combining frameworks without testing their logical compatibility. Readers fare no better — they are trained to ask 'Is this theory true?' before asking 'Is this theory coherent?' or 'What methodological commitments does accepting it require?' This engine makes theory-building visible as a practice. It identifies the specific moves: Where does the author commit to a paradigm? Where do they construct middle-range explanations? Where do they bootstrap concepts across domains? Where do they synthesize competing frameworks? Where do they innovate new concepts? Each move carries implications and risks that remain invisible until explicitly surfaced.

  The philosophical foundation draws on three traditions. Thomas Kuhn's analysis of paradigmatic science reveals how overarching frameworks constrain what questions can be asked and what counts as an answer — the paradigm is not just a theory but a way of seeing that makes some phenomena visible and others invisible. Robert Merton's sociology of knowledge articulates the distinctive character of middle-range theories that mediate between grand theory and empirical generalization — modest enough to be testable, general enough to be theoretically interesting. Susan Leigh Star and James Griesemer's concept of boundary objects illuminates how certain concepts function across multiple communities precisely because their flexibility allows different groups to use them while maintaining enough robustness to sustain identity. Together, these traditions provide the vocabulary for analyzing theory as constructed artifact rather than discovered truth.

  Within the logic analysis suite, this engine occupies the methodological position — it examines not the content of arguments but the architecture of theoretical frameworks and the moves by which they are assembled. It shares conceptual territory with argument_architecture (which maps how arguments are constructed) and epistemological_method_detector (which identifies how claims are justified). It differs from both by focusing specifically on theory-building as a distinctive intellectual practice with its own norms, tradeoffs, and failure modes. The engine's outputs feed naturally into inferential_commitment_mapper, which can then trace the downstream implications of the paradigmatic commitments and conceptual borrowings this engine identifies.

  Commitment to analyzing theory construction matters because theories shape what we can think. A theory is not merely a description of reality but a lens that determines what becomes visible, what questions become askable, what answers become conceivable. When we adopt a theory unreflectively, we inherit its constraints without awareness. When we construct theories unreflectively, we build in limitations we cannot see. The discipline of making theory-building explicit — of asking not just 'What does this theory claim?' but 'How was this theory built, and what does that construction commit us to?' — is prerequisite to genuine theoretical sophistication. Only by understanding theory as constructed can we become capable of constructing better theories.
researcher_question: How does the text construct its theoretical framework, and what
  are the methodological commitments underlying its theory-building?
intellectual_lineage:
  primary:
    name: kuhn
    description: Thomas Kuhn (1922–1996), American philosopher and historian of science
      whose 'The Structure of Scientific Revolutions' (1962) transformed understanding
      of how scientific knowledge develops. His concept of paradigms — overarching
      frameworks that define legitimate problems, methods, and solutions within a
      scientific community — provides this engine's foundation for understanding how
      theoretical work operates within constraining assumptions that often remain
      invisible to practitioners. Kuhn's insight that paradigm shifts involve not
      just new theories but new ways of seeing makes visible the deep commitments
      encoded in any theoretical framework.
  secondary:
  - name: merton
    description: Robert K. Merton (1910–2003), American sociologist who articulated
      the concept of 'theories of the middle range' — theoretical constructions that
      mediate between grand unified theories and mere empirical generalizations. His
      methodological writings provide the vocabulary for assessing when theories are
      appropriately modest versus overreaching, and how scope conditions determine
      a theory's proper domain of application.
  - name: star
    description: Susan Leigh Star (1954–2010), American sociologist and information
      scientist who, with James Griesemer, developed the concept of 'boundary objects'
      — concepts or artifacts flexible enough to be meaningful across different communities
      of practice while robust enough to maintain identity. This concept illuminates
      how certain theoretical terms function precisely because of their productive
      ambiguity.
  - name: lakatos
    description: Imre Lakatos (1922–1974), Hungarian philosopher of science who developed
      the methodology of scientific research programmes, distinguishing between a
      theory's 'hard core' of unfalsifiable commitments and its 'protective belt'
      of auxiliary hypotheses. His framework provides tools for mapping which elements
      of a theoretical construction are foundational versus derivative.
  - name: laudan
    description: Larry Laudan (1941–2022), American philosopher of science whose work
      on research traditions and problem-solving effectiveness provides criteria for
      assessing theoretical progress beyond simple truth claims. His emphasis on theories
      as problem-solving instruments grounds the evaluation of theoretical parsimony
      and fecundity tradeoffs.
  traditions:
  - name: history_of_science
    description: The historical study of scientific development reveals that theories
      are not discovered but constructed through specific social and intellectual
      processes. This tradition provides concrete examples of how paradigms constrain
      inquiry, how concepts migrate across domains, and how theoretical innovations
      emerge from crisis and creative recombination.
  - name: sociology_of_knowledge
    description: The sociological examination of how knowledge is produced, legitimated,
      and transmitted within communities. This tradition emphasizes that theory-building
      is a social practice embedded in institutional contexts, and that theoretical
      concepts often serve boundary-spanning functions across different epistemic
      communities.
  - name: philosophy_of_science
    description: 'The normative and descriptive analysis of scientific reasoning,
      theory structure, and theory change. This tradition provides the conceptual
      vocabulary for analyzing theoretical architecture: what makes a theory well-formed,
      what distinguishes legitimate from illegitimate theoretical moves, how theories
      relate to evidence.'
  - name: pragmatist_epistemology
    description: The philosophical tradition emphasizing that theories are instruments
      for organizing experience and guiding action rather than mirrors of nature.
      This orientation grounds the assessment of theoretical parsimony and fecundity
      — theories are evaluated by what they enable us to do, not merely by correspondence
      to an independent reality.
  - name: conceptual_history
    description: The study of how concepts emerge, transform, and migrate across intellectual
      contexts. This tradition, associated with Reinhart Koselleck and Quentin Skinner,
      provides methods for tracking conceptual bootstrapping — how terms carry hidden
      freight from their domains of origin into new theoretical contexts.
  key_concepts:
  - name: paradigm
    definition: An overarching framework of assumptions, methods, and exemplary solutions
      that defines a scientific community's approach to inquiry. Paradigms constrain
      what questions can be asked, what methods are legitimate, and what counts as
      a satisfactory answer — often without practitioners' awareness of these constraints.
  - name: middle_range_theory
    definition: Theoretical constructions that occupy the space between grand unified
      theories and empirical generalizations. Middle-range theories specify mechanisms
      for delimited phenomena with explicit scope conditions, making them testable
      while remaining theoretically substantive.
  - name: boundary_object
    definition: Concepts, methods, or artifacts that maintain enough stability to
      be recognizable across different communities of practice while remaining flexible
      enough to serve different purposes in different contexts. Boundary objects facilitate
      communication across epistemic communities precisely through their productive
      ambiguity.
  - name: conceptual_bootstrapping
    definition: The intellectual move of importing concepts from one domain and repurposing
      them in another. Bootstrapping transfers not just the concept but often hidden
      assumptions, connotations, and inferential connections from the source domain
      — sometimes productively, sometimes distortingly.
  - name: theoretical_parsimony
    definition: The methodological value of explaining phenomena with the minimum
      necessary theoretical apparatus. Parsimony trades against fecundity — the ability
      of a theory to generate new insights, predictions, and research directions.
      Appropriate balance depends on the phenomenon and stage of inquiry.
  - name: operationalization
    definition: The translation of abstract theoretical concepts into observable,
      measurable indicators. Operationalization is necessary for empirical engagement
      but always involves decisions that may distort what the concept originally meant,
      creating gaps between theoretical and operational definitions.
  - name: scope_conditions
    definition: The explicit or implicit boundaries delimiting where a theory claims
      to apply. Scope conditions specify the domain within which a theory's mechanisms
      are expected to operate, distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate applications
      and preventing overreach.
  - name: hard_core
    definition: In Lakatos's framework, the central commitments of a research programme
      that are treated as unfalsifiable by methodological decision. The hard core
      is protected by a belt of auxiliary hypotheses; anomalies are addressed by modifying
      the belt rather than abandoning the core.
analytical_dimensions:
- key: paradigmatic_commitment
  description: The overarching theoretical framework within which the text operates,
    whether explicitly acknowledged or implicitly assumed. This dimension examines
    how paradigmatic assumptions constrain inquiry, what questions become askable,
    and where the text pushes against or transcends its paradigmatic boundaries.
  probing_questions:
  - What theoretical paradigm organizes the text's approach to its subject?
  - Is the paradigmatic commitment explicit or must it be inferred?
  - What questions does the paradigm make it impossible to ask?
  - Where does the text strain against paradigmatic constraints?
  - What would the analysis look like from an alternative paradigm?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the named theoretical tradition or school the text affiliates
      with.
    standard: Trace how paradigmatic assumptions shape problem selection, methodology,
      and acceptable solutions, noting both explicit and implicit commitments.
    deep: Analyze tensions between paradigmatic constraints and the phenomena the
      text addresses, identifying where the paradigm enables insight and where it
      produces blind spots, and assessing the text's self-awareness about its paradigmatic
      location.
- key: middle_range_construction
  description: How the text builds theories of delimited scope that specify mechanisms
    for particular phenomena with explicit conditions of application. This dimension
    examines the balance between theoretical ambition and empirical tractability,
    assessing whether the theory's scope is appropriately modest or overreaching.
  probing_questions:
  - What specific phenomenon does the theory claim to explain?
  - What mechanisms are proposed to account for the phenomenon?
  - What scope conditions delimit where the theory applies?
  - Are the scope conditions explicit or must they be reconstructed?
  - Does the theory overreach its evidence or remain appropriately modest?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the main phenomenon explained and the primary mechanism proposed.
    standard: Map the complete explanatory structure including scope conditions, auxiliary
      assumptions, and testable implications.
    deep: Assess the theory's positioning in the space between grand theory and empirical
      generalization, evaluating whether scope conditions are appropriate, whether
      mechanisms are adequately specified, and where the theory's ambition exceeds
      its evidential warrant.
- key: conceptual_transfer
  description: Where and how the text imports concepts from one domain and deploys
    them in another. This dimension traces what is preserved in the transfer (structural
    relationships, content, connotations) and what is distorted, assessing whether
    the bootstrapping is acknowledged and whether it produces insight or confusion.
  probing_questions:
  - What concepts does the text borrow from other domains?
  - What is the source domain and what connotations travel with the concept?
  - What structural features are preserved versus distorted in transfer?
  - Is the borrowing acknowledged or silent?
  - Does the transfer produce genuine insight or merely relabeling?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note obvious metaphors and borrowed terminology with their source domains.
    standard: Analyze what the transferred concepts carry from their origin — assumptions,
      inferential connections, evaluative connotations — and how these affect the
      new theoretical context.
    deep: Assess whether conceptual transfers are productive (illuminating new aspects
      of the target domain) or distorting (importing inappropriate assumptions), and
      evaluate the text's reflexivity about its borrowings.
- key: theoretical_synthesis
  description: How the text brings multiple theoretical frameworks into relationship
    — whether as complements, competitors, or elements to be synthesized. This dimension
    examines the logical compatibility of combined frameworks, the quality of synthesis
    achieved, and whether combinations produce genuine insight or mere eclecticism.
  probing_questions:
  - What distinct theoretical frameworks does the text combine?
  - Are the combined frameworks logically compatible?
  - Is the combination presented as complementary, competitive, or synthetic?
  - Does the synthesis produce emergent insight unavailable from either framework
    alone?
  - Where do tensions between frameworks remain unresolved?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the distinct theoretical frameworks invoked and their basic
      relationship.
    standard: Analyze the logical compatibility of combined frameworks, identifying
      where they reinforce each other, where they create tension, and how the text
      manages conflicts.
    deep: Assess synthesis quality — whether the combination produces genuine theoretical
      innovation, whether incompatibilities are resolved or merely papered over, and
      whether the result is coherent integration or unprincipled eclecticism.
- key: conceptual_innovation
  description: Where the text introduces new concepts or substantially redefines existing
    ones. This dimension assesses whether innovations do genuine analytical work that
    existing concepts cannot do, or whether they merely relabel familiar phenomena
    without adding explanatory power.
  probing_questions:
  - What new concepts does the text introduce?
  - What existing concepts, if any, does the innovation replace or supplement?
  - What analytical work does the new concept enable?
  - Does the concept carve nature at its joints or impose arbitrary distinctions?
  - Is the innovation necessary or could existing vocabulary suffice?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify novel terminology and basic definitions offered.
    standard: Analyze what the new concept adds to existing vocabulary — what distinctions
      it makes possible, what phenomena it makes visible, what it enables that prior
      concepts could not.
    deep: Assess whether the innovation is theoretically necessary (doing work no
      existing concept could do) or merely terminological (relabeling without analytical
      gain), and evaluate how the concept positions itself in relation to existing
      conceptual infrastructure.
- key: theory_evidence_articulation
  description: How the text connects its theoretical claims to empirical evidence
    — whether generating theory from evidence, testing theory against evidence, or
    iterating abductively between them. This dimension examines the strength of theory-evidence
    connections and where gaps or tensions exist.
  probing_questions:
  - 'What is the direction of inference: evidence to theory, theory to evidence, or
    iterative?'
  - How are abstract concepts operationalized into observable indicators?
  - Does operationalization preserve or distort concept meaning?
  - Where is the connection between theory and evidence strongest?
  - Where are theory-evidence gaps most significant?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify the basic pattern of theory-evidence relationship and key operationalizations.
    standard: Analyze how theoretical constructs are translated into empirical indicators,
      assessing construct validity and identifying where operationalization may distort
      meaning.
    deep: Assess the overall integrity of the theory-evidence relationship, identifying
      where connections are robust, where they are strained, and where the text's
      empirical claims exceed what its evidence can support.
capabilities:
- key: paradigm_identification
  description: Identifies the overarching theoretical paradigm within which a text
    operates and traces how paradigmatic commitments constrain inquiry.
  extended_description: |-
    Every theoretical work operates within a paradigm — a framework of assumptions, methods, and exemplary solutions that defines what questions can be asked and what counts as an answer. Most paradigmatic commitments remain invisible to authors and readers alike, functioning as the unexamined background against which explicit theorizing occurs. This capability makes paradigms visible.

    Drawing on Kuhn's analysis of scientific revolutions, the capability distinguishes between the explicit theoretical claims a text makes and the deeper paradigmatic assumptions that make those claims possible. A Marxist analysis of inequality operates within assumptions about class, exploitation, and historical materialism that a Weberian analysis would not share — yet both may present themselves as simply 'analyzing inequality' without acknowledging their paradigmatic divergence.

    The capability traces not only what paradigm the text inhabits but how that paradigm constrains inquiry: what questions cannot be asked, what methods are ruled out, what phenomena become invisible. It also identifies where texts strain against paradigmatic boundaries, potentially signaling paradigm crisis or innovation.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: kuhn
    concept: paradigm
    method: Identifies the shared assumptions, methods, and exemplary solutions that
      define a scientific community's approach, tracing how these constrain inquiry

  - Unargued assumptions about causation, agency, or method
  - Systematic exclusion of certain questions or approaches
  - Characteristic vocabulary associated with particular paradigms

- key: middle_range_mapping
  description: Maps the structure of middle-range theories including phenomena, mechanisms,
    scope conditions, and testable implications.
  extended_description: |-
    Robert Merton distinguished middle-range theories from both grand theoretical systems (too abstract to test) and empirical generalizations (too narrow to be theoretically interesting). Middle-range theories occupy the productive middle ground: they specify mechanisms for delimited phenomena with explicit scope conditions, making them both empirically tractable and theoretically substantive. This capability maps their architecture.

    The capability identifies four components of middle-range construction: the phenomenon to be explained (what puzzle motivates the theory), the mechanisms proposed (how the explanation works), the scope conditions (where the theory claims to apply), and the testable implications (what the theory predicts that could be checked). A well-constructed middle-range theory makes all four explicit; many theories leave one or more implicit or unclear.

    Assessing middle-range construction involves evaluating appropriateness of ambition. Some theories overreach, claiming to explain more than their mechanisms and evidence warrant. Others are too timid, failing to extract general lessons from specific cases. The capability identifies where theories fall on this spectrum and whether their scope conditions are appropriate to their explanatory apparatus.

- key: bootstrapping_detection
  description: Detects where concepts are imported from one domain and repurposed
    in another, tracking what is preserved and distorted in transfer.
  extended_description: |-
    Theoretical innovation often proceeds by conceptual borrowing — importing terms, frameworks, or models from one domain into another. Evolution migrates from biology to economics, metabolism from physiology to urban studies, network from mathematics to sociology. These transfers are rarely neutral. Concepts carry freight from their origin: assumptions, connotations, inferential connections that travel with the term even when unacknowledged.

    This capability traces conceptual bootstrapping with attention to what transfers. Structure may be preserved while content changes (mathematical models applied to social phenomena). Content may be preserved while connotations shift (efficiency in engineering versus economics). Hidden assumptions may transfer unnoticed (biological concepts importing teleological or competitive frameworks). The productive question is not whether bootstrapping occurs — it is ubiquitous — but whether it is acknowledged and whether it produces insight or distortion.

    The capability assesses bootstrapping quality. Productive transfers illuminate new aspects of the target domain by importing analytical tools that reveal previously invisible patterns. Distorting transfers import inappropriate assumptions that mischaracterize the target domain. The difference often lies in the author's reflexivity about what is being borrowed and what may not translate.

- key: boundary_object_identification
  description: Identifies concepts that function across multiple communities of practice
    through productive flexibility.
  extended_description: |-
    Some concepts succeed precisely because they mean different things to different people. 'Sustainability' bridges environmental science, economics, and policy. 'Innovation' connects business, technology, and social reform. These are boundary objects — terms flexible enough to be meaningful across different communities while robust enough to maintain recognizable identity. Their ambiguity is not a bug but a feature.

    Star and Griesemer developed this concept studying how different groups (scientists, administrators, amateurs) collaborated at a natural history museum despite having different goals and frameworks. Shared objects — specimens, classification systems, maps — allowed coordination without requiring consensus on meaning. Theoretical concepts can function similarly, enabling communication across epistemic communities precisely because different groups can use them for different purposes.

    This capability identifies boundary objects and assesses their function. Sometimes productive flexibility facilitates genuine interdisciplinary work, allowing different communities to coordinate while maintaining their distinctive approaches. Sometimes ambiguity obscures fundamental disagreements, allowing apparent consensus that masks deep incompatibilities. The capability distinguishes these cases and identifies where boundary objects serve communication and where they impede it.
  intellectual_grounding:

- key: parsimony_fecundity_assessment
  description: Evaluates the tradeoff between theoretical simplicity and explanatory
    richness.
  extended_description: |-
    Theories face an inherent tension between parsimony (explaining with minimal apparatus) and fecundity (generating rich implications and new directions). A parsimonious theory is easier to test, apply, and teach — but may miss essential complexity. A fecund theory captures more nuance and generates more research — but may become unwieldy or unfalsifiable. The appropriate balance depends on the phenomenon, the stage of inquiry, and the theory's purposes.

    This capability assesses where theories fall on the parsimony-fecundity spectrum and whether their position is appropriate. Some phenomena demand complexity — social systems with multiple interacting causes cannot be captured by simple models without distortion. Others are better served by deliberate simplification — isolating key mechanisms even at cost of completeness. The question is not whether a theory is simple or complex but whether its complexity matches its task.

    The assessment draws on Laudan's pragmatist philosophy of science, which evaluates theories as problem-solving instruments. A theory's value lies in what it enables: predictions, explanations, interventions, further inquiry. Parsimony and fecundity are instrumental virtues — each valuable for what it allows. The capability identifies where theories could be simplified without loss, where oversimplification misses essential complexity, and whether the theory's architecture is appropriate to its explanatory ambitions.

  description: Evaluates the logical coherence and productivity of theoretical combinations.
  extended_description: |-
    Theoretical work often combines multiple frameworks — Marxist analysis with Foucauldian insights, rational choice theory with institutional analysis, cognitive science with phenomenology. Such combinations range from productive syntheses that generate genuine new understanding to unprincipled eclecticism that papers over fundamental incompatibilities. This capability assesses synthesis quality.

    The first question is logical compatibility. Some frameworks share deep assumptions that make combination natural. Others rest on incompatible foundations — different views of agency, causation, or explanation that cannot be reconciled without transformation. Combining incompatible frameworks produces apparent richness that conceals incoherence. The capability identifies where combined frameworks share sufficient common ground for synthesis and where their differences run too deep.

    The second question is synthetic productivity. Even compatible frameworks may combine without generating insight — mere addition rather than multiplication. Productive synthesis produces emergent understanding unavailable from either framework alone, new questions neither could ask independently, or resolution of problems each faced separately. The capability distinguishes genuine synthetic innovation from the mere juxtaposition of compatible ideas.

    description: Survey the text to identify its basic theoretical orientation. Note
      the named theoretical tradition or school, obvious metaphors and borrowed terminology,
      and the general pattern of theory-evidence relationship. This pass establishes
      the surface features of theory construction without deep analysis of how these
      elements function or interact.

    description: Map the basic architecture of theory construction. Identify the paradigmatic
      framework (explicit or implicit), the middle-range theories being built (phenomena,
      mechanisms, scope conditions), and the conceptual transfers being performed
      (source domains, what transfers). This pass produces an inventory of theory
      construction elements.

    description: Using the inventory from pass 1, analyze the theory's overall architecture.
      Assess how different elements fit together, whether theoretical combinations
      are coherent, whether conceptual innovations do genuine work, and where the
      theory-evidence relationship is strongest or weakest. This pass produces an
      integrated assessment of theory construction quality.

    description: 'Deep excavation of paradigmatic commitments. Identify not only the
      named theoretical tradition but the implicit assumptions that shape inquiry:
      what questions can be asked, what methods are legitimate, what counts as evidence,
      what explanatory forms are acceptable. Trace where the paradigm enables insight
      and where it creates blind spots. Assess the text''s reflexivity about its paradigmatic
      location.'

    description: Archaeological reconstruction of theory-building moves. Trace how
      middle-range theories are assembled — which concepts are foundational, which
      derived, how mechanisms are specified, how scope conditions are established.
      Examine conceptual transfers in depth — what travels from source domains, what
      distorts, whether borrowings are acknowledged. Identify conceptual innovations
      and assess whether they do genuine analytical work.

    description: Critical evaluation of theoretical combinations and theory-evidence
      relationships. Test whether combined frameworks are logically compatible or
      whether synthesis papers over fundamental tensions. Identify boundary objects
      and assess whether they facilitate or obscure communication. Examine operationalization
      moves and assess construct validity. Identify where the theory-evidence relationship
      is weakest.

    description: Synthetic assessment of the theory's vulnerabilities and strengths.
      Identify the weakest joints in the theoretical construction — where paradigmatic
      assumptions are most questionable, where middle-range theories overreach, where
      conceptual transfers distort, where synthesis is unprincipled, where theory-evidence
      gaps are widest. Assess what accepting the theory commits one to and what alternatives
      it forecloses. Produce a comprehensive map of the theory's methodological commitments
      and their implications.
