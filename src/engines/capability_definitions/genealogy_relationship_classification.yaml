  Not all prior works are equal. When we trace the intellectual genealogy
  of an argument, we must first classify the NATURE of each relationship
  before we can determine how deeply to investigate it. A methodological
  ancestor -- one whose analytical tools were adopted wholesale -- demands
  a fundamentally different investigation than an indirect contextualizer
  that merely set the broader intellectual climate.

  This engine performs that triage. For each prior work, it asks: what is
  the precise intellectual relationship to the current argument? Is this
  a direct precursor whose ideas flow straight into the current work? A
  contradicted position that the author argues against? A parallel
  development where similar ideas emerged independently? The classification
  is not merely taxonomic -- it is STRATEGIC. It determines the depth and
  direction of all subsequent genealogical scanning.

  The five relationship types form a spectrum of influence directness:
  direct_precursor (the current argument could not exist without this work),
  indirect_contextualizer (sets the stage but does not directly feed the
  argument), methodological_ancestor (provides the HOW rather than the WHAT),
  contradicted_position (the current work defines itself AGAINST this), and
  parallel_development (convergent evolution of ideas without causal link).

  The classification also assesses CHANNELS of influence -- does the prior
  work contribute vocabulary, methodology, audience preparation, authority,
  or framing? These channels determine where to look for traces in Pass 2.
  A methodological ancestor leaves traces in analytical structure; a
  contradicted position leaves traces in argumentative rhetoric; an
  indirect contextualizer leaves traces in presupposed background knowledge.

  Speed matters here. This engine operates on truncated excerpts and must
  classify rapidly. It is a triage instrument, not a deep analysis tool.
  Its value lies in enabling the genealogical pipeline to allocate
  investigative resources efficiently -- spending deep attention where it
  will yield the richest findings.
researcher_question: What is the precise intellectual relationship between this prior work and the current
  argument?
intellectual_lineage:
  primary:
    name: bloom
    description: 'Harold Bloom (1930-2019), American literary critic whose theory of the ''anxiety of
      influence'' revolutionized how we understand intellectual genealogy by positing that creative work
      emerges not from passive reception but from active misreading and struggle with precursors. His
      six revisionary ratios provide this engine''s fundamental insight: that relationships between texts
      are never neutral transmissions but strategic negotiations involving distortion, completion, and
      repression. Bloom''s framework makes it possible to classify influence not as binary presence/absence
      but as a spectrum of defensive and transformative stances toward prior works.'
  secondary:
  - name: skinner
    description: Quentin Skinner (1940-), British historian and leading figure of the Cambridge School,
      whose contextualist methodology insists that intellectual meaning emerges from recovering what authors
      were *doing* in their historical moment—what speech acts they were performing. Skinner's approach
      corrects Bloom's sometimes ahistorical psychologizing by grounding relationship classification in
      documentary evidence of actual reading, citation, and argumentative intent. For this engine, Skinner
      provides the methodological rigor to distinguish genuine precursors from anachronistic projections,
      ensuring that classified relationships reflect historical realities rather than superficial thematic
      similarities.
  - name: grafton
    description: 'Anthony Grafton (1950-), American historian of the book whose forensic analysis of footnotes,
      marginalia, and scholarly apparatus reveals the material traces of intellectual relationships. Grafton''s
      work on citation practices demonstrates that influence channels are empirically detectable through
      specific textual markers—vocabulary adoption, argumentative structure, reference patterns. His method
      gives this engine its evidentiary foundation: relationship types (precursor, contextualizer, methodological
      ancestor) leave distinct documentary signatures that can be identified even in truncated excerpts,
      making rapid triage classification possible.'
  - name: lovejoy
    description: Arthur O. Lovejoy (1873-1962), American philosopher and founder of the history of ideas,
      whose 'unit-ideas' method tracks concepts across disciplinary and temporal boundaries to reveal
      hidden genealogies. Lovejoy's approach enables this engine to recognize parallel developments—instances
      where similar ideas emerge independently without causal influence—by distinguishing between shared
      conceptual units (which may develop convergently) and specific argumentative formations (which indicate
      direct transmission). His work underwrites the crucial distinction between genuine precursors and
      mere topical neighbors in intellectual space.
  traditions:
  - name: anxiety_of_influence
    description: The critical tradition emerging from Bloom's work that treats intellectual relationships
      as fundamentally agonistic rather than cumulative, characterized by creative misprision, defensive
      distortion, and strategic forgetting. This tradition provides this engine's core insight that relationship
      classification must account for *how* ideas are transformed in transmission—whether adopted, inverted,
      repressed, or completed—not merely whether influence occurred. It frames the classification task
      as identifying the precise mode of struggle or appropriation that defines each genealogical link.
  - name: cambridge_school
    description: The contextualist methodology in intellectual history, pioneered by Skinner and Pocock,
      that insists on recovering authorial intention and historical speech-act contexts to avoid anachronistic
      interpretation. This tradition disciplines this engine's classification process by requiring that
      relationship types be grounded in recoverable historical evidence—actual citation networks, documented
      reading, temporal priority—rather than thematic similarity alone. It provides the methodological
      constraints that prevent the engine from projecting false genealogies based on superficial conceptual
      overlap.
  - name: reception_history
    description: The tradition of Rezeptionsgeschichte that studies how texts are actively reinterpreted
      and reappropriated by successive audiences and authors, treating meaning as co-created through historical
      reception rather than fixed at origin. This tradition informs the engine's understanding that a
      work can function as precursor, contextualizer, or contradicted position depending on how it is
      *taken up* by the current argument—the same prior text might serve different genealogical roles
      in different intellectual contexts. It shifts classification focus from intrinsic textual properties
      to relational dynamics of reading and response.
  - name: bibliometrics
    description: 'The quantitative study of citation patterns, co-citation networks, and publication relationships
      to map intellectual influence structures empirically. This tradition provides this engine with its
      commitment to speed and triage efficiency: by treating certain influence signals as rapidly detectable
      markers (citation density, vocabulary overlap, structural homology), bibliometric methods enable
      quick classification that can be refined through deeper analysis later. It validates the engine''s
      strategic approach of fast initial sorting followed by selective deep investigation.'
  - name: intellectual_history
    description: 'The discipline that studies the development and transmission of ideas across time, tracking
      how concepts, arguments, and methodologies evolve through networks of thinkers and texts. This tradition
      provides the broadest framework for the engine''s operation: the understanding that ideas have genealogies
      that can be traced, that influence operates through multiple channels (vocabulary, methodology,
      framing, audience preparation), and that intellectual relationships form complex ecosystems requiring
      systematic classification. It grounds the engine''s purpose within an established scholarly methodology
      for reconstructing how arguments come to be.'
  key_concepts:
  - name: anxiety_of_influence
    definition: The concept that creative intellectual work emerges through struggle with precursors,
      involving active misreading, selective appropriation, and defensive distortion rather than passive
      reception. This engine uses the concept to recognize that relationship types represent different
      modes of agonistic engagement—from direct precursor (acknowledged debt) to contradicted position
      (overt struggle) to parallel development (anxiety avoidance through independent invention).
  - name: intentionalism
    definition: The methodological principle that intellectual relationships must be classified based
      on recoverable authorial intentions and historical contexts rather than interpreter-imposed thematic
      patterns. The engine applies this by prioritizing documentary evidence of actual engagement—citation,
      explicit reference, temporal sequence—over speculative connections based on conceptual similarity
      alone.
  - name: footnote_as_evidence
    definition: 'The forensic principle that scholarly apparatus (citations, references, bibliographies)
      provides material traces revealing the nature and depth of intellectual relationships. This engine
      treats citation patterns as diagnostic markers: direct precursors appear in sustained engagement,
      methodological ancestors in structural attribution, indirect contextualizers in casual background
      reference, enabling rapid relationship classification from textual markers.'
  - name: influence_channels
    definition: 'The distinct pathways through which prior works shape subsequent arguments—vocabulary
      transmission, methodological adoption, audience preparation, authority lending, conceptual framing.
      The engine uses channel identification to refine relationship classification: a methodological ancestor
      transmits analytical tools, an indirect contextualizer prepares conceptual vocabulary, a contradicted
      position shapes argumentative rhetoric, each leaving characteristic traces that guide further investigation.'
  - name: intellectual_triage
    definition: 'The strategic practice of rapidly classifying intellectual relationships to allocate
      investigative resources efficiently, distinguishing which genealogical links warrant deep analysis
      versus cursory acknowledgment. This is the engine''s core function: sorting prior works into relationship
      categories that determine subsequent depth of scanning—direct precursors receive intensive tracing,
      parallel developments minimal attention.'
  - name: convergent_evolution
    definition: The phenomenon where similar ideas or arguments emerge independently in separate intellectual
      contexts without causal transmission, analogous to biological convergent evolution. The engine must
      distinguish this relationship type (parallel development) from genuine genealogical descent (direct
      precursor) by examining temporal sequences, citation networks, and whether shared elements are general
      conceptual units versus specific argumentative formations.
  - name: strategic_classification
    definition: 'The understanding that relationship classification is not merely taxonomic description
      but a decision-making tool that directs subsequent analytical investment—determining where to look,
      how deeply to read, and what kinds of traces to seek. The engine embodies this concept by treating
      its five relationship types as investigative strategies: each classification prescribes a different
      genealogical scanning protocol for Pass 2 analysis.'
analytical_dimensions:
- key: relationship_type
  description: |
    The core classification: what kind of intellectual relationship exists between the prior work and the current work? This is a forced-choice among five types, each with distinct implications for how subsequent passes should investigate the connection.
  probing_questions:
  - Does the current argument directly build on, extend, or refine ideas from this prior work? (direct_precursor)
  - Does this prior work set a broader intellectual context without directly feeding specific arguments?
    (indirect_contextualizer)
  - Does the current work borrow analytical tools, methods, or frameworks from this prior work? (methodological_ancestor)
  - Does the current work explicitly or implicitly argue against positions taken in this prior work? (contradicted_position)
  - Do similar ideas appear in both works without evidence of direct causal influence? (parallel_development)
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Assign one of the five relationship types based on the most prominent signal
    standard: Assign relationship type with a brief justification citing specific textual evidence from
      both works, noting any secondary relationship types that also apply

    Textual and structural evidence supporting the classification. What specific passages, citations, arguments, or structural echoes justify assigning this relationship type? Evidence quality determines classification confidence.
  probing_questions:
  - Are there direct citations or acknowledgments linking the works?
  - Do shared vocabulary or technical terms appear across both works?
  - Are there structural parallels in argument organization or methodology?
  - Does the current work respond to, critique, or extend specific claims from the prior work?
  - Are there conspicuous absences -- ideas that SHOULD be cited but are not?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Cite 1-2 strongest pieces of evidence
    standard: Gather 3-5 pieces of evidence including citations, vocabulary overlap, structural parallels,
      and conspicuous absences

    standard: Assign strength with assessment of centrality, pervasiveness, and evidence directness
    deep: Nuanced strength assessment including how strength varies across different aspects of the work,
      whether strength is increasing or decreasing over time, and comparison to other prior works' influence
- key: influence_channels
  description: |
    Through which specific channels does the prior work influence the current work? Vocabulary (shared terms and concepts), methodology (analytical tools and approaches), audience (preparation of readers), authority (credibility lending), and framing (how problems are defined and structured). Multiple channels may be active simultaneously.
  probing_questions:
  - Does the current work adopt vocabulary or technical terms from the prior work?
  - Does the current work use methodological approaches pioneered or refined in the prior work?
  - Did the prior work prepare an audience that the current work now addresses?
  - Does the author's authority on this topic derive partly from the prior work?
  - Does the prior work frame the problem space in ways the current work inherits?

    surface: Identify the 1-2 most active influence channels
    standard: Map all active channels with specific evidence for each and relative importance ranking
    deep: 'Full channel analysis: all active channels, their interactions, how channels reinforce or undermine
      each other, and which channels the author is aware of vs. which operate below conscious awareness'

  description: |
    How does this classification affect downstream genealogical analysis? What should Pass 2 scanning prioritize given this relationship type? This dimension bridges classification and strategy -- it translates the taxonomic judgment into operational guidance.
  probing_questions:
  - Given this relationship type, what dimensions should Pass 2 scan for most carefully?
  - What kinds of traces should the scanner expect to find?
  - How much attention should this prior work receive relative to others?
  - What would a missed classification (wrong type) cost in analytical quality?

  extended_description: |-
    This capability performs the fundamental act of intellectual triage that determines all downstream genealogical investigation. Drawing on Harold Bloom's insight that influence is not uniform but takes specific forms—the anxiety-laden struggle with precursors, the strategic misreading, the deliberate evasion—it asks: what is the precise mode of connection between this prior work and the current argument? The classification is not merely descriptive but strategic, recognizing that a direct_precursor (whose ideas flow directly into the current work) demands close textual comparison for vocabulary transfers and argumentative inheritances, while a methodological_ancestor (whose tools rather than conclusions were adopted) requires scanning for structural parallels and analytical frameworks. A contradicted_position (against which the current work defines itself) leaves traces in rhetorical moves and oppositional framing, while a parallel_development (where similar ideas emerged independently) requires evidence of NON-connection—the absence of citations, the different vocabularies, the divergent intellectual contexts.

    This capability enables all subsequent genealogical work by determining how deeply and in what manner each prior work should be investigated. Without accurate classification, the genealogical pipeline wastes investigative resources: scanning a methodological_ancestor for vocabulary transfers yields nothing, while treating a direct_precursor as mere context misses the core of the relationship. The classification also determines which dimensions of relationship_evidence matter most and which influence_channels are likely to be active. It is the hinge between discovery (identifying that a relationship exists) and analysis (understanding what kind of relationship it is).

    What makes this non-trivial is that relationships are often hybrid or contested. An author may treat a work as indirect context while actually borrowing its methodology wholesale; a contradicted position may simultaneously function as a direct precursor for the very terms of debate. The capability must assign a primary type while remaining alert to secondary types, and must distinguish between the author's conscious relationship to a prior work and the actual intellectual connection. A naive classification reads only explicit citations; a sophisticated one reads structural echoes, conspicuous absences, and the difference between acknowledged and unacknowledged debts.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: bloom
    concept: anxiety_of_influence
    method: Bloom argues that influence is not passive reception but active struggle, taking specific
      forms (clinamen, tessera, kenosis, etc.). This capability applies that insight by insisting that
      relationships must be typed—that the mode of influence determines its traces and effects.
  indicators:
  - Explicit citations that frame the prior work in specific ways ("building on," "extending," "challenging,"
    "in the context of")
  - Vocabulary clusters that appear in both works but with different theoretical freight or framing
  - Methodological parallels (similar analytical moves, similar data structures, similar argument architectures)
    without explicit acknowledgment
  - Oppositional rhetoric that defines the current position against an earlier one ("unlike X," "while
    previous approaches," "against the conventional view")
  - 'Parallel independent development signals: similar publication dates, different intellectual circles,
    no citation trail, different terminologies for similar ideas'
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Primary relationship type assigned based on strongest single textual signal (e.g., explicit
      citation framing or methodological parallel).
    standard: Primary type with brief justification from textual evidence, plus identification of any
      secondary relationship types that also apply.
    deep: Primary and secondary types with full evidence, assessment of whether relationship has shifted
      over time, analysis of discrepancy between author's framing and actual connection, evaluation of
      whether author would agree with classification.
- key: assess_strength
  description: Evaluate the strength of the intellectual relationship on a three-point scale
  produces_dimensions:
  - relationship_strength
  requires_dimensions:
  - relationship_type
  extended_description: |-
    This capability evaluates the intensity and pervasiveness of the intellectual relationship, recognizing that not all direct_precursors are equally direct, not all methodological_ancestors equally ancestral. Drawing on bibliometric traditions that distinguish between ceremonial citations and constitutive ones, it asks three questions: How central is this prior work to the current argument's possibility (could the argument exist without it)? How pervasive is the influence (does it affect one section or the entire work)? How direct is the evidence (explicit citation, implicit borrowing, or structural echo)? A strong relationship means the current work could not exist in its present form without the prior work; a moderate relationship means significant but not constitutive influence; a weak relationship means peripheral or highly localized influence.

    This capability directly feeds strategic_relevance by determining attention allocation. A strong direct_precursor demands intensive Pass 2 scanning across multiple dimensions; a weak indirect_contextualizer may require only surface scanning for general framing. Without strength assessment, the pipeline treats all relationships as equal, wasting deep analysis on peripheral works while under-investigating formative ones. The capability also interacts with relationship_type: strength means different things for different types. A strong contradicted_position might appear throughout the work's rhetorical structure; a strong methodological_ancestor might be cited only once but structure every analytical move.

    The non-trivial challenge is distinguishing genuine strength from ceremonial prominence. A work cited frequently might be weak (mere authority-lending); a work cited once might be strong (the single citation marking adoption of an entire framework). Strength also varies by aspect: a prior work might strongly influence methodology but weakly influence substantive claims. A sophisticated assessment tracks these variations rather than forcing a single strength rating.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: grafton
    concept: footnote_as_evidence
    method: Grafton demonstrates that citation patterns reveal intellectual relationships when read critically—not
      all footnotes signify equal debt. This capability applies that insight by assessing centrality,
      pervasiveness, and evidence directness rather than simply counting citations.
  indicators:
  - 'Counterfactual test signals: language suggesting the current work builds essentially on the prior
    ("following," "as X showed," "X''s framework allows us to")'
  - 'Pervasiveness signals: the prior work appears in multiple sections, frames multiple arguments, or
    structures the overall analytical approach'
  - 'Evidence directness: explicit block quotes and detailed engagement vs. passing citation vs. no citation
    but clear structural borrowing'
  - 'Negative evidence: conspicuous absence of a work that should be cited given the topic, suggesting
    anxiety or deliberate avoidance'
  - 'Comparative prominence: how this prior work is treated relative to others in the same category'
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Strong/moderate/weak assignment based on citation frequency and centrality language in one
      or two key passages.
    standard: Strength rating with separate assessment of centrality (could argument exist without it),
      pervasiveness (whole work or sections), and evidence directness (explicit vs. implicit).
    deep: Nuanced strength profile showing how strength varies across different aspects of the work (methodology
      vs. substance), whether strength is stable or shifting over time, and comparative strength relative
      to other prior works in the genealogy.
- key: map_influence_channels
  description: 'Identify the specific channels through which influence flows: vocabulary, methodology,
    audience, authority, framing'
  produces_dimensions:
  - influence_channels
  requires_dimensions:
  - relationship_type
  - relationship_evidence
  extended_description: |-
    This capability identifies the specific vectors through which intellectual influence travels, recognizing that prior works shape current arguments through distinct channels: vocabulary (terms and concepts adopted or adapted), methodology (analytical tools and frameworks), audience (preparation of readers to receive certain arguments), authority (credibility that transfers to the current author), and framing (how problems are defined and bounded). Drawing on Cambridge School contextualism—particularly Skinner's attention to how concepts carry their histories and Pocock's focus on vocabularies as carriers of tradition—it asks not just whether influence exists but through what specific conduits it flows. A methodological_ancestor typically influences through methodology and possibly framing channels; a direct_precursor often through vocabulary and framing; a contradicted_position through framing (defining the problem space) and potentially authority (positioning against an established view).

    This capability is crucial for strategic_relevance because it determines what Pass 2 scanners should look for. If the influence channel is primarily vocabulary, subsequent scanning should focus on concept_evolution and vocabulary_transfer dimensions. If methodology, then structural_inheritance and analytical_framework dimensions become priority. If audience, then reception_history and presupposition_structure dimensions matter most. The capability also reveals channel interactions: vocabulary transfers often carry methodological assumptions; audience preparation often involves authority transfer. Multiple channels can be active simultaneously, and their relative importance varies by relationship type.

    The non-trivial dimension is that channels often operate below conscious awareness. An author may acknowledge vocabulary borrowing while remaining unaware of methodological inheritance; conversely, an author may credit methodological influence while the actual channel is problem framing. Channels can also be negative—a contradicted position's vocabulary might be deliberately avoided even as its problem framing is inherited. A sophisticated mapping distinguishes between channels the author recognizes and those operating implicitly.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: skinner
    concept: intentionalism
    method: Skinner argues that understanding a text requires reconstructing what the author was doing
      with inherited concepts and vocabularies. This capability applies that insight by mapping the specific
      channels (vocabulary, methodology, framing) through which those inheritances travel.
  indicators:
  - 'Vocabulary signals: technical terms from the prior work appearing in the current work, especially
    if defined similarly or adapted with explicit acknowledgment'
  - 'Methodology signals: parallel analytical moves, similar data structures, similar forms of evidence
    or argumentation, adoption of specific analytical frameworks'
  - 'Audience signals: statements assuming readers know the prior work, references to debates the prior
    work initiated, positioning within a conversation the prior work established'
  - 'Authority signals: citations that lend credibility ("as the definitive study shows"), appeals to
    the prior work''s empirical or theoretical authority'
  - 'Framing signals: adoption of how the prior work defines the problem, bounds the domain, identifies
    what counts as evidence, or structures the analytical space'
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Identification of the 1-2 most obviously active channels based on explicit citations and
      clear vocabulary transfers.
    standard: Complete channel map with specific evidence for each active channel and relative importance
      ranking (primary, secondary, tertiary).
    deep: Full channel analysis showing interactions between channels (vocabulary transfers carrying methodological
      assumptions), channels reinforcing or undermining each other, and distinction between channels the
      author consciously recognizes versus those operating below awareness.

  extended_description: |-
    This capability translates the taxonomic judgments of classification, strength assessment, and channel mapping into operational guidance for downstream genealogical passes. It asks: given that this prior work has been classified as (type) with (strength) through (channels), what should Pass 2 dimensional scanners prioritize? What kinds of traces should they expect to find? How much investigative attention should this prior work receive relative to others? Drawing on the bibliometric tradition's resource allocation logic and the broader intellectual history tradition's understanding that not all archival work yields equal insight, it performs strategic triage. A strong direct_precursor with active vocabulary and framing channels demands high-attention scanning across concept_evolution, vocabulary_transfer, argument_structure_inheritance, and presupposition_structure dimensions. A weak indirect_contextualizer with only audience-preparation channels requires only surface scanning of reception_history and contemporaneous_discourse dimensions.

    This capability bridges Pass 1.5 and Pass 2, transforming classification into action. It prevents the genealogical pipeline from treating all prior works uniformly, enabling efficient allocation of what is always the scarcest resource: deep analytical attention. It also produces contingency guidance: what would a missed classification cost? If this work was misclassified, what signals would emerge in Pass 2 to prompt reclassification? The capability must balance precision (scanning exactly where traces are likely) against flexibility (remaining open to unexpected findings). It also accounts for interaction effects: some prior works should be scanned together because their channels reinforce each other; others should be scanned separately because they represent competing influences.

    The non-trivial challenge is that strategic guidance must be specific enough to direct attention but flexible enough to accommodate surprise. A naive strategy says "scan everything for strong precursors, skip everything for weak contextualizers." A sophisticated strategy says "for this strong methodological_ancestor, prioritize structural_inheritance and analytical_framework dimensions, expect methodological traces in argument architecture rather than explicit citation, allocate high attention but concentrate it in structural analysis; if Pass 2 finds strong vocabulary transfers instead, reclassify as potential direct_precursor and expand scanning to concept_evolution."
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: lovejoy
    concept: intellectual_triage
    method: Lovejoy's method of tracing unit-ideas requires determining which historical connections merit
      deep investigation versus passing acknowledgment. This capability applies that triage logic by translating
      relationship classifications into prioritized scanning strategies.
  indicators:
  - 'Classification-strategy fit signals: certain relationship types predictably generate specific trace
    patterns (methodological_ancestors leave structural traces, contradicted_positions leave rhetorical
    traces)'
  - 'Strength-attention correlation signals: language in the current work indicating centrality or pervasiveness
    that demands high-attention investigation'
  - 'Channel-dimension alignment signals: active influence channels map onto specific Pass 2 dimensions
    (vocabulary channel → concept_evolution dimension)'
  - 'Trace expectation signals: evidence suggesting where scanning should look (methodology channel active
    → expect traces in analytical architecture, not just citations)'
  - 'Misclassification risk signals: ambiguous or hybrid relationships where getting the type wrong would
    send Pass 2 in the wrong direction'
  depth_scaling:
    surface: One-sentence scanning recommendation (e.g., "High attention, prioritize structural inheritance
      and vocabulary transfer dimensions").

    deep: Complete strategic guidance including ranked priority dimensions with specific hypotheses for
      each, expected trace types with concrete examples, attention allocation with justification, misclassification

      Full classification with textual evidence from both works.
      Relationship type assigned with justification and secondary
      types noted. Strength assessed across centrality (could the
      argument exist without this prior work), pervasiveness (whole
      work or specific sections), and evidence directness (explicit
      citation vs. implicit reliance).

      With relationship type and strength established, map all five
      influence channels (vocabulary, methodology, audience, authority,
      framing) with specific evidence for each. Translate the complete
      classification into operational scanning strategy: priority
      dimensions ranked, expected trace types, and recommended
      attention level for Pass 2 dimensional scanners.

      Nuanced classification with primary and secondary types, each
      supported by detailed textual evidence. Assessment of how the
      relationship may have shifted over time — was this work a
      direct precursor early in the author's career that became mere
      background later? Strength profiled across different aspects
      (methodology vs. substance) with temporal stability assessment.

    description: |
      Full channel interaction analysis. Map all five influence
      channels with detailed evidence, then analyze how channels
      reinforce or undermine each other — vocabulary transfers
      carrying methodological assumptions, audience preparation
      enabling authority transfer. Distinguish channels the author
      recognizes from those operating below awareness. Identify
      negative channels where influence operates through deliberate
      avoidance or rejection.

      Translate the complete classification into detailed strategic
      guidance for downstream passes. Priority dimensions ranked
      with specific hypotheses for each. Expected trace types with
      concrete examples. Attention allocation with justification.
      Misclassification risk assessment — what would a wrong
      classification cost? Contingency instructions for revising
      classification if Pass 2 evidence contradicts it. Identify
      prior works that should be scanned together due to
      reinforcing channels.
