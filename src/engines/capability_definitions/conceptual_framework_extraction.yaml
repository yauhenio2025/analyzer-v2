  Every intellectual work is built on a scaffolding of analytical
  frameworks -- theoretical models, typologies, causal stories,
  analytical lenses -- that structure what can be seen, what counts
  as evidence, and what conclusions are reachable. But frameworks
  are not just tools of analysis; they are themselves carriers of
  intellectual history. An author's vocabulary reveals their training.
  Their methodological signature -- how they characteristically argue --
  persists across decades, mutating but recognizable. Their metaphors
  do real analytical work, not just decoration, and the metaphors that
  migrate from one work to the next are genealogy gold: tracers
  revealing intellectual lineage.

  This engine extracts the full conceptual architecture of a work:
  the frameworks deployed, the vocabulary introduced or repurposed,
  the methodological habits that structure argumentation, the metaphors
  that carry analytical weight, and the framing choices that foreground
  some aspects while rendering others invisible. It asks not just
  "what frameworks are used?" but "what does the choice and handling
  of these frameworks reveal about the author's intellectual formation?"

  The genealogical dimension is central. Terms that feel established
  but are not justified in the current text alone -- they rely on
  authority accumulated elsewhere. Methodological moves that feel
  habitual -- they trace back years, sometimes decades. Metaphors
  doing heavy analytical lifting -- they probably evolved from simpler
  forms in earlier work. These are the threads that downstream engines
  (semantic constellation, inferential commitment mapper) will pull on.

  As the FIRST engine in the target profiling chain, this engine
  produces the foundational profile that all subsequent analysis
  builds upon. Its vocabulary map becomes the search targets for
  semantic constellation mapping. Its commitment landscape feeds
  the inferential commitment mapper. Get this profile wrong, and
  the entire genealogical analysis inherits the distortion.

  description: |
    The complete lexical inventory of the work: terms coined by the author, standard terms used non-standardly, key oppositions that structure the argument, and precursor terms that might have been used for the same concept in earlier work. Vocabulary is the most reliable genealogical tracer -- authors change their arguments, but their distinctive terms persist.
  probing_questions:
  - What terms does the author coin or use distinctively?
  - Which standard terms are given non-standard meanings?
  - What key oppositions structure the argument (e.g., structure/agency, system/lifeworld)?
  - Which terms feel 'settled' without adequate justification in this text -- are
    they borrowing authority from elsewhere?
  - What precursor terms might have existed for the same concept in earlier work?
  - Are there terminological clusters that suggest a particular intellectual tradition?

- key: methodological_signature
  description: |
    How the author characteristically argues: what counts as evidence, what logical structures recur, what analytical moves are habitual. Methodological signatures are the most persistent feature of an author's intellectual identity -- they change arguments, switch topics, revise positions, but their WAY OF ARGUING remains recognizable across decades.
  probing_questions:
  - What types of evidence does the author rely on (historical narrative, data, theoretical
    derivation, analogy, case study, thought experiment)?
  - What is the characteristic argumentative structure (dialectical, cumulative, abductive,
    deductive, genealogical)?
  - What analytical moves recur (reframing X as Y, appeals to structural necessity,
    deriving from historical narrative, immanent critique)?
  - What counts as sufficient evidence for a claim -- what are the author's epistemological
    commitments?
  - Are there signature rhetorical patterns that function as analytical tools?
  depth_guidance:

- key: metaphor_tracking
  description: |
    Metaphors and analogies that do real analytical work in the text -- not decorative language but structural elements that shape what can be thought. A metaphor that carries heavy argumentative weight is a genealogical prize: it probably evolved from simpler forms in earlier work, gaining analytical power as the author refined it.
  probing_questions:
  - What metaphors or analogies carry heavy argumentative weight -- doing real analytical
    work, not just illustration?
  - Which metaphors are borrowed from other domains, and what do they import along
    with themselves?
  - Are any metaphors treated as literal -- has the author forgotten they are metaphors?
  - Do metaphors cluster by framework, suggesting they evolved together?
  - Which metaphors feel 'mature' -- polished through repeated use -- vs. tentative?

      same metaphor differently'
- key: framing_analysis
  description: |
    How the work frames its central problem, what it foregrounds and backgrounds, and how the author positions themselves relative to allies and opponents. Framing is never neutral: every presentation emphasizes some aspects and renders others invisible. Tracking how framing changes across an author's works reveals strategic evolution.
  probing_questions:
  - How is the central problem or question framed -- what does this framing make visible
    and invisible?
  - What does the author claim is novel or original in their contribution?
  - What continuity with prior work does the author claim?
  - Who are the intellectual opponents -- what is the author positioned against?
  - Who are the intellectual allies -- whose authority is borrowed?
  - What does the framing suppress -- qualifications, alternatives, complications
    that are absent?

    surface: Identify the central framing, what it emphasizes, and who the main allies/opponents
      are

      its field, what alternative framings were available but not used (and why),

    The structural relationships between frameworks: which are foundational, which are dependent, which compete, which are complementary. The architecture reveals the load-bearing elements -- remove a foundational framework and everything above it collapses.
  probing_questions:
  - Which frameworks are foundational -- everything else depends on them?
  - Which frameworks are peripheral -- could be removed without structural damage?
  - Do any frameworks compete with each other -- offering alternative explanations
    for the same phenomena?
  - Are there emergent frameworks synthesized from multiple component frameworks?

    ones?

      hoc?)'
- key: domain_crossings
  description: |
    Where concepts, methods, or structural analogies are imported from other fields. Each crossing is a potential genealogical thread -- it reveals where the author was trained, what they read, and what shapes their thinking below conscious awareness. An economist doing political theory doesn't just have economic ideas; they have an economic WAY OF THINKING.
  probing_questions:
  - What concepts, methods, or analogies are imported from other fields?
  - How have imports been adapted for the current domain -- what was changed and what
    was preserved?
  - Are the cross-domain origins acknowledged or invisible to the author?
  - Do imports create productive insights or misleading analogies?
  - What intellectual training or background do the domain crossings reveal?
  depth_guidance:

    key oppositions, and genealogical tracers'
  produces_dimensions:
  - vocabulary_map
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability performs lexical archaeology on an intellectual work, excavating not just what terms mean in the current text but what genealogical work they do. Following Brandom's insight that vocabularies are inferentially articulated—each term comes bundled with commitment patterns—this extraction identifies coined terms (new vocabulary introduced to carve conceptual space), repurposed terms (existing vocabulary given non-standard inferential profiles), and key oppositions (conceptual pairs that structure the argumentative field). The goal is not a dictionary but a map of conceptual authority: which terms carry weight earned in this text versus borrowed from elsewhere, which terminological choices reveal intellectual lineage, which vocabularies mark the author as trained in particular traditions.

    This capability is foundational for the entire engine. The vocabulary map becomes the search signature for downstream semantic constellation analysis—you cannot track how terms migrate across works without first knowing which terms matter. It feeds the methodological signature by revealing disciplinary markers (economists don't just use different concepts than sociologists; they use different vocabularies for the SAME concepts). It enables domain crossing detection by identifying when technical vocabulary from one field appears in another. Without vocabulary extraction, all subsequent analysis lacks targets.

    The sophisticated version distinguishes between three types of unearned authority: terms borrowing from the author's own prior work (requiring diachronic genealogy), terms borrowing from a recognized tradition (requiring synchronic mapping to schools of thought), and terms that feel established but have no clear pedigree (the most interesting case—possible coinages that have been naturalized through rhetorical confidence). A naive extraction lists important words; a sophisticated one reveals intellectual debts.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: brandom
    concept: vocabulary as inferentially articulated
    method: Brandom argues vocabularies are not mere labels but nodes in inferential
      networks—to introduce a term is to introduce patterns of what follows from what.
      This capability treats vocabulary extraction as inferential profile mapping,
      asking not just 'what does X mean?' but 'what inferential commitments does using
      X incur?'
  indicators:
  - Terms introduced with explicit definition or stipulation ('By X I mean...', 'Let
    us call this...', 'I propose the concept...')
  - Standard terms used in non-standard ways, especially when the author marks the
    departure ('Unlike the usual sense of X...', 'X in my sense...')
  - Key oppositions structuring arguments (repeated either/or framings, contrastive
    pairs doing analytical work)
  - Terms appearing without justification but carrying heavy argumentative weight—signs
    of borrowed authority
  - Clusters of specialized vocabulary from identifiable disciplines or theoretical
    traditions

    logical structures, recurring moves, epistemological commitments'
  produces_dimensions:
  - methodological_signature
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability extracts the author's argumentative fingerprint—the persistent methodological habits that constitute their intellectual identity across topics and positions. Drawing on Lakatos's insight that research programmes are distinguished not by their content but by their heuristics (their characteristic ways of generating and testing claims), this profiling asks: what counts as evidence for this author? What logical structures recur? What analytical moves feel habitual rather than chosen? The output is a methodological signature that persists even when the author changes fields, revises positions, or addresses new problems. An economist doing political theory doesn't just import economic concepts; they import economic WAYS OF ARGUING—preferences for formal models over narrative, optimization assumptions, equilibrium thinking.

    This capability is critical for genealogical analysis because methodological signatures are the most stable element of intellectual identity. Authors abandon frameworks, revise positions, even repudiate earlier work, but they rarely change their fundamental way of arguing. The profile feeds the architectural analysis by revealing which frameworks are truly load-bearing versus decorative (the frameworks that align with the author's methodological habits do the real work). It enables comparison across an author's corpus, detecting when a methodological shift signals genuine intellectual transformation versus surface revision. It reveals implicit epistemological commitments—what the author treats as sufficient warrant often betrays deeper philosophical assumptions than their explicit methodology statements.

    The sophisticated version distinguishes between conscious methodological choices (announced, defended, explicitly theoretical) and unreflective habits (recurring patterns the author may not recognize as methodological). It detects mismatches between stated methodology and actual practice—the historian who claims to avoid counterfactuals but structures every causal argument around implicit comparison with what didn't happen. It identifies signature moves that function as analytical tools: the characteristic Foucauldian reversal (taking what seems like progress and reading it as power consolidation), the Marxian derivation (showing how surface phenomena emerge necessarily from deeper structures).
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: lakatos
    concept: research programme heuristics
    method: Lakatos argues research programmes are identified by their heuristics—not
      their specific claims but their characteristic ways of generating problems,
      devising solutions, and responding to anomalies. This capability treats authors
      as embodiments of research programmes, extracting the heuristic patterns that
      structure their argumentative practice.
  indicators:
  - Recurring evidence types (heavy reliance on historical narrative, preference for
    formal models, repeated use of thought experiments, appeal to case studies)
  - Characteristic argumentative structures (dialectical patterns, cumulative building,
    abductive inference chains, genealogical tracing)
  - Signature analytical moves that appear across different arguments (reframing,
    deriving, immanent critique, structural necessity appeals)
  - Explicit methodological statements that can be compared with actual practice to
    detect gaps
  - Patterns in what counts as sufficient warrant—when does the author stop arguing
    and consider a claim established?

    surface: Identifies primary evidence types and 2-3 recurring analytical moves
    standard: Full profile of evidence types, argumentative structures, recurring
      moves with examples, and implicit epistemological commitments

    their likely origins and maturity
  produces_dimensions:
  - metaphor_tracking
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability identifies metaphors and analogies that do genuine analytical work—not rhetorical decoration but structural elements that shape what can be thought. Following Cassirer's analysis of symbolic forms as constitutive of thought (metaphors don't illustrate pre-existing ideas; they enable certain ideas to be formulated at all), this tracking distinguishes load-bearing metaphors from ornamental ones. A load-bearing metaphor imports an entire structural logic from its source domain: treating the mind as a computer doesn't just illustrate cognitive science, it commits you to particular claims about information processing, storage, and retrieval. The goal is to map which metaphors are doing real work, what they import along with themselves, and which ones have been naturalized to the point where the author no longer recognizes them as metaphors.

    Metaphors are genealogical gold because they evolve visibly across an author's work. A metaphor introduced tentatively in an early paper ('Let me try thinking of X as like Y...') becomes confident in later work ('X is essentially Y'), gaining analytical weight through repeated deployment and refinement. Tracking metaphor maturity—fresh coinages versus polished through reuse—reveals which ideas are new versus which have been long incubating. This capability feeds domain crossing detection (metaphors are the primary vehicle for importing concepts across fields) and supports architectural analysis (frameworks often cluster around shared root metaphors). It reveals what the author finds thinkable: the metaphors you habitually use constrain what conclusions you can reach.

    The sophisticated version asks not just what metaphors are present but what they make visible and invisible. The social contract metaphor foregrounds voluntary agreement and backgrounds coercion; the organic society metaphor foregrounds holistic interdependence and backgrounds individual agency. It tracks whether the author treats metaphors as heuristic tools (consciously deployed, explicitly provisional) or as literal descriptions (the metaphorical origin forgotten). It identifies metaphor clusters that suggest frameworks evolved together, sharing a common root image that structures multiple concepts simultaneously.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: cassirer
    concept: symbolic forms as constitutive
    method: Cassirer argues symbolic forms (including metaphors) don't represent pre-existing
      reality but constitute what can be thought—they are not illustrative but generative.
      This capability treats metaphors as analytical infrastructure, asking what thought-structures
      each metaphor enables and constrains.
  indicators:
  - Extended analogies that structure entire arguments or sections (sustained comparison
    across multiple features)
  - Metaphors from other domains carrying technical implications (computational metaphors
    importing information theory, biological metaphors importing evolutionary logic)
  - Repeated metaphors across different contexts suggesting they are load-bearing
    rather than decorative
  - Metaphors treated as literal—claims that X 'is' Y rather than 'is like' Y, suggesting
    naturalization
  - Competing metaphors for the same phenomenon, revealing tension in how the author
    conceptualizes it

    surface: Lists 3-5 prominent metaphors with source domains and rough assessment

  produces_dimensions:
  - framing_analysis
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability maps how the work frames its central problem—what it foregrounds, backgrounds, and suppresses—and how the author positions themselves within the intellectual field. Drawing on Kuhn's insight that paradigms define not just what counts as an answer but what counts as a legitimate question, framing analysis asks: what does this way of posing the problem make thinkable? What alternatives are rendered invisible? How does the framing constrain the space of possible conclusions? Every framing is a strategic choice (conscious or not) that emphasizes some aspects while rendering others peripheral. Tracking how an author frames problems across works reveals strategic evolution—learning what questions get traction, what framings attract allies, what moves neutralize opponents.

    This capability is essential for understanding the politics of intellectual work. The author's novelty claims reveal what they consider valuable contributions; their continuity claims reveal which traditions they seek membership in; their ally/opponent map reveals which debates they consider themselves participating in. The framing also reveals suppressions—qualifications not made, alternatives not considered, complications not addressed. These absences are often more revealing than presences: what an author doesn't feel they need to argue against tells you what they assume their audience already accepts. The framing feeds architectural analysis (foundational frameworks typically appear in the problem framing itself) and enables comparison across an author's work (tracking whether they consistently frame problems the same way or strategically adapt).

    The sophisticated version asks what alternative framings were available but not chosen, and why. It analyzes the politics of framing: whose interests are served by this way of posing the question? What audiences does this framing address or exclude? It detects when framing does hidden argumentative work—when the way a problem is posed already presupposes part of the answer. It compares stated framing with actual argumentative practice, detecting cases where the announced problem and the problem actually addressed diverge.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: kuhn
    concept: paradigms as question-defining
    method: Kuhn argues paradigms don't just provide answers but define what counts
      as a legitimate question—normal science operates within question-spaces structured
      by paradigmatic exemplars. This capability treats problem framing as paradigmatic
      work, asking what question-space the framing opens and closes.
  indicators:
  - Explicit problem statements, especially in introductions ('The question this book
    addresses...', 'The central puzzle is...')
  - Novelty claims marking what the author considers their original contribution ('Unlike
    previous accounts...', 'What has been missed is...')
  - Continuity claims positioning the work within traditions ('Building on X...',
    'Following Y...', 'In the spirit of Z...')
  - Opponent identification—who the author argues against, what positions are rejected
  - Absent qualifications—dogs that don't bark, alternatives not considered, complications
    not addressed despite seeming relevant

  produces_dimensions:
  - conceptual_architecture

  - methodological_signature
  extended_description: |-
    This capability reveals the structural relationships between frameworks—which are foundational (everything depends on them), which are peripheral (could be removed without collapse), which compete (offering alternative explanations), which are complementary (mutually reinforcing). Following Lakatos's distinction between the hard core of a research programme (protected from refutation) and its protective belt (adjusted under empirical pressure), architectural mapping identifies load-bearing elements versus disposable scaffolding. A foundational framework is one whose removal causes cascading collapse; a peripheral framework can be excised without structural damage. The output is a dependency graph showing what rests on what.

    This analysis is critical for genealogical work because it reveals which frameworks are truly constitutive of the author's thought versus which are borrowed tools used opportunistically. When tracking an author's intellectual development, changes to foundational frameworks signal genuine transformation; changes to peripheral frameworks are tactical adjustments. The architecture also reveals synthesis patterns—emergent frameworks built by combining component frameworks, showing how authors integrate diverse influences into coherent positions. It enables comparative analysis: two authors might deploy the same frameworks but arrange them differently, with different elements foundational.

    The sophisticated version performs load-bearing assessment by asking counterfactually: if we removed framework X, what would collapse? It distinguishes between logical dependence (framework B presupposes claims made by framework A) and rhetorical dependence (framework B needs A's authority to be convincing). It identifies tensions—competing frameworks that generate contradictory implications, revealing unresolved theoretical problems. It detects when the architecture is well-integrated (frameworks fit together systematically) versus ad hoc (frameworks selected opportunistically without concern for coherence).
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: lakatos
    concept: hard core versus protective belt
    method: Lakatos distinguishes research programmes' hard core (fundamental assumptions
      protected from refutation) from their protective belt (auxiliary hypotheses
      adjusted under pressure). This capability treats frameworks as differentially
      protected, mapping which are core (foundational, load-bearing) versus peripheral
      (adjustable, disposable).
  indicators:
  - Frameworks explicitly identified as foundational or presupposed ('The argument
    rests on...', 'Starting from the assumption that...', 'Everything that follows
    depends on...')
  - Frameworks repeatedly invoked across different arguments, suggesting they are
    load-bearing
  - Competing explanations for the same phenomenon, revealing framework tension
  - Synthesis claims where the author explicitly combines multiple frameworks ('Drawing
    on both X and Y...', 'Integrating A with B...')
  - Frameworks that appear early in the text and structure what follows versus frameworks
    introduced locally for specific arguments

  produces_dimensions:
  - domain_crossings
  requires_dimensions:
  - vocabulary_map
  extended_description: |-
    This capability identifies when concepts, methods, or structural analogies are imported from other fields, and analyzes what these crossings reveal about the author's intellectual formation. Every domain crossing is a genealogical tracer: an economist doing political theory doesn't just happen to use game theory—their training shaped them to see strategic interaction everywhere. A literary critic using psychoanalytic concepts brings not just Freudian vocabulary but Freudian assumptions about interpretation (everything is symptomatic, meaning is hidden, surface appearances deceive). Following the insight that disciplinary training operates partly through unconscious habit formation, this detection asks: what does the author's cross-domain toolkit reveal about where they were trained, what they read, what shapes their thinking below conscious awareness?

    Domain crossings do double work: they import analytical power (concepts honed in one domain often illuminate another) but also smuggle assumptions. When rational choice theory crosses from economics to political science, it imports not just utility maximization but methodological individualism, preference stability assumptions, and consequentialist ethics. The sophisticated analysis asks whether crossings are productive (genuinely illuminating the target domain) or distorting (imposing inappropriate structure). It tracks whether the author acknowledges the crossing (explicit borrowing with reflection on appropriateness) or whether imports operate invisibly (the author doesn't recognize their assumptions as domain-specific).

    This capability is particularly valuable for revealing intellectual formation that the author might not consciously recognize. A philosopher trained in analytic philosophy and later working in continental philosophy doesn't just switch vocabularies—their analytic training shows in their argumentative style, their standards of rigor, their preference for clear definitions over suggestive ambiguity. These stylistic markers are domain crossings of method rather than content. The capability feeds back into vocabulary extraction (technical terms from other fields) and methodological profiling (domain-specific argument styles).
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: kuhn
    concept: disciplinary matrices and training
    method: Kuhn argues scientific training operates through exemplars—paradigmatic
      problem-solutions that teach not just content but ways of seeing. This capability
      treats domain crossings as traces of disciplinary matrices, asking what ways-of-seeing
      from other fields the author imports along with specific concepts.
  indicators:
  - Technical vocabulary from other disciplines appearing without definition (suggesting
    the author assumes that conceptual framework)
  - Methods characteristic of other fields (formal modeling in humanistic work, hermeneutic
    interpretation in social science, experimental design in philosophy)
  - Structural analogies importing logic from other domains ('The economy is like
    an ecosystem', 'Society is like a text')
  - Citation patterns showing significant engagement with literature from other fields
  - Argumentative moves characteristic of other disciplines (proof-styles from mathematics,
    causal identification strategies from economics, genealogical tracing from history)

      A single sweep across the text to capture the dominant conceptual
      landscape. Prioritize the most visible frameworks, the 5-10 most
      distinctive vocabulary items, the primary methodological pattern,
      and the 3-5 metaphors doing the heaviest analytical work. For
      architecture and domain crossings, note only what is immediately
      apparent -- foundational frameworks and obvious cross-field imports.
      The goal is a rapid but honest sketch, not exhaustive coverage.

      Systematic inventory of the four independent dimensions. Build the
      full vocabulary map with coined terms, repurposed terms, key
      oppositions, and genealogical tracers. Profile the methodological
      signature including evidence types, argumentative structure, and
      recurring analytical moves. Catalog metaphors with their source
      domains and analytical weight. Map the framing landscape: problem
      framing, novelty/continuity claims, ally/opponent positioning.
      This pass produces the raw material that architectural analysis
      requires.

      With the vocabulary map and methodological profile in hand, now
      map the structural relationships between frameworks. Identify
      which frameworks are foundational, dependent, peripheral, or
      competing. Trace domain crossings using the vocabulary inventory
      as evidence -- cross-field imports often hide in borrowed terminology.
      Assess how adaptations changed the original concepts and what
      assumptions they smuggled in. The architecture should reveal load-
      bearing elements whose removal would collapse the argument.

      Exhaustive inventory with no significance threshold. Every coined
      term, every repurposed term, every terminological cluster traced
      to its intellectual tradition. Full methodological fingerprint
      cross-referenced with traditions that favor these methods, including
      mismatches between stated and practiced methodology. Complete
      metaphor archaeology: maturity assessment (fresh vs. polished
      through reuse), what each metaphor reveals and conceals. Framing
      politics: what alternative framings were available but not used,
      who benefits from the chosen framing. Leave nothing for later

      Build the complete structural skeleton of the work's conceptual
      apparatus. Map every dependency between frameworks -- foundational,
      dependent, peripheral, competing, complementary, emergent. Perform
      load-bearing assessment: what collapses if each framework is
      removed? Trace every cross-domain import to its source tradition,
      assess how adaptation changed the original, and map what the source
      domain's assumptions smuggle into the current argument. The
      architecture should be detailed enough to serve as a structural
      blueprint of the author's intellectual edifice.

      Synthesize all dimensions into the complete target profile that
      downstream engines will consume. Cross-reference vocabulary clusters
      with architectural dependencies -- do terminological families align
      with framework hierarchies? Assess how the methodological signature
      constrains which frameworks can be deployed. Evaluate the coherence
      of the whole ensemble: does the conceptual architecture support the
      framing claims? Do domain crossings enrich or distort the framework
      architecture? Produce genealogical implications: what does this
      profile predict about the author's intellectual formation, and what
      should downstream engines (semantic constellation, inferential
      commitment mapper) look for?
