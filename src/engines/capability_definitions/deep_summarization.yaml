  What does a text actually argue, and how does it construct its argument?
  Surface summaries capture what a text says; deep summarization captures what
  a text DOES — the architectural logic, rhetorical strategies, conceptual
  moves, what's foregrounded and suppressed. A 300-word summary tells you the
  topic; a deep summarization tells you the thesis architecture, chapter-by-chapter
  argument map, evidence patterns, rhetorical deployment, vocabulary structure,
  and where the argument's load-bearing walls are.

  This distinction matters because downstream analytical engines — concept
  extraction, semantic constellation mapping, inferential commitment analysis,
  evolution tracking — all require understanding not just WHAT claims are made
  but HOW the argument is constructed. A concept that appears in a foundational
  chapter carries different analytical weight than one that appears in an excursus.
  An evidence pattern that dominates one section but disappears in another reveals
  something about the argument's internal tensions. The vocabulary an author
  borrows, modifies, or invents tells us about their intellectual debts and
  innovations.

  Deep summarization is the foundation upon which all other analytical operations
  build. Without it, engines operate on texts they don't understand — producing
  technically sophisticated analyses of arguments whose basic architecture they
  haven't grasped. It serves both target works (where the full 8-dimension
  analysis is essential) and prior/background works (where vocabulary and thesis
  architecture feed directly into genealogical scanning).

researcher_question: What does this text actually argue, how does it construct its argument, and what does it foreground or suppress?

intellectual_lineage:
  primary:
    name: toulmin
    description: Stephen Toulmin (1922-2009), British philosopher whose model of practical argument — claims, grounds, warrants, backing, qualifiers, rebuttals — provides the foundation for analyzing how arguments are actually constructed rather than how formal logic says they should be. His insight that arguments are practical instruments, not logical derivations, grounds this engine's attention to the functional architecture of texts rather than their formal structure.
  secondary:
    - name: perelman
      description: Chaïm Perelman (1912-1984), Belgian philosopher of law whose New Rhetoric revived the study of practical argumentation and audience-directed persuasion, emphasizing that argument structure adapts to its audience and purpose — essential for understanding why academic texts organize their arguments the way they do.
    - name: foucault
      description: Michel Foucault (1926-1984), whose analysis of discursive formations reveals how texts systematically include and exclude, foreground and suppress — the pattern of what's said and unsaid being as analytically significant as the explicit argument.
    - name: koselleck
      description: Reinhart Koselleck (1923-2006), German historian whose Begriffsgeschichte (conceptual history) methodology provides tools for mapping how conceptual vocabulary functions within texts — not just what terms mean but what intellectual work they perform.
    - name: peirce
      description: Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914), American pragmatist whose semiotics and theory of abductive inference inform this engine's attention to how evidence patterns function as sign systems within arguments — what counts as evidence, how it's deployed, and what it signifies about the argument's commitments.
  traditions:
    - name: rhetoric
      description: The classical and modern rhetorical tradition from Aristotle through Perelman and Burke, providing analytical tools for understanding how texts persuade, organize, and deploy evidence for strategic purposes.
    - name: discourse_analysis
      description: The Foucauldian tradition of analyzing what discursive formations include and exclude, what subject positions they construct, and how they produce the objects they claim merely to describe.
    - name: conceptual_history
      description: The Koselleckian tradition of tracking how concepts function within texts, how vocabulary structures argument, and how terminological choices reveal intellectual commitments and debts.
    - name: pragmatist_epistemology
      description: The Peircean tradition of understanding knowledge claims as embedded in practices of inquiry, where evidence patterns and inferential structures reveal an author's epistemic commitments.
  key_concepts:
    - name: thesis_architecture
      definition: The structural organization of a text's central and supporting claims, their logical dependencies, and the unstated premises that hold the argument together — the load-bearing structure beneath the surface content.
    - name: argumentative_weight
      definition: The differential importance of different parts of a text to the overall argument — some sections are load-bearing (the argument collapses without them), others are supporting (they enrich but aren't essential).
    - name: foregrounding_and_suppression
      definition: The pattern of what a text emphasizes and what it minimizes or omits, following Foucault's insight that what's absent from a discourse is often as analytically significant as what's present.
    - name: conceptual_vocabulary
      definition: The network of key terms, their definitions (given vs. operational), semantic fields, borrowed terminology, and terminological innovations that structure a text's intellectual framework.
    - name: downstream_utility
      definition: The analytical value of a summarization for subsequent engines — what entry points, complexities, and productive questions the summary enables for deeper analysis.
