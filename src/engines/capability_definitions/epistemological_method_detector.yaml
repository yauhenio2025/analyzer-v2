  Every text that makes knowledge claims carries within it a hidden philosophy of knowledge itself. Before an author can assert what is true, they must assume—consciously or not—what counts as knowledge, who can produce it, how it can be validated, and what its limits are. These epistemological methods are the invisible scaffolding upon which all other claims rest. A phenomenologist brackets the natural attitude to examine essential structures of experience. A standpoint theorist argues that social position shapes what can be known. A pragmatist evaluates truth by practical consequences rather than correspondence to reality. A naturalized epistemologist treats knowing as a natural process to be studied empirically. Each method doesn't just describe knowledge differently; it produces different knowledge, excludes different questions, and authorizes different knowers. The epistemological method is not neutral infrastructure but active architecture that shapes everything built upon it.

  Most academic texts operate with epistemological commitments they never name. Authors write as if from nowhere while claiming that all knowledge is situated. They assert with certainty while professing fallibilism. They demand reflexivity from others while exempting themselves. They invoke epistemic justice while reproducing the very testimonial hierarchies they critique. This gap between explicit epistemological pronouncements and implicit epistemological practice is where the most revealing analysis occurs. The text's stated methodology is often a performance; its actual methodology is embedded in how it handles evidence, constructs authority, manages uncertainty, and positions itself relative to its objects of study. This engine surfaces the actual epistemological machinery at work, not merely the epistemological vocabulary on display.

  The philosophical foundations here are multiple and sometimes tensioned. Husserl's phenomenological method, with its rigorous bracketing and attention to the structures of intentional consciousness, provides one pole. Feminist epistemology—particularly Hartsock's standpoint theory, Harding's strong objectivity, and Haraway's situated knowledges—provides another, insisting that the knower's social location shapes what can be known and that marginalized positions often afford epistemic advantage. Fricker's work on epistemic injustice reveals how knowledge-production is always also a domain of power, where some testimony is systematically discredited and some experiences lack the interpretive resources to be understood. Quine's naturalized epistemology and the pragmatist tradition from Peirce through Dewey to Rorty offer alternatives that dissolve traditional epistemological questions or translate them into empirical ones. This engine doesn't adjudicate between these traditions but detects their presence, often unacknowledged, in texts that draw on them selectively.

  Within the logic analysis suite, this engine occupies a unique meta-position. While argument_architecture maps the inferential structure of claims and dialectical_structure tracks the movement of positions, this engine asks a prior question: what epistemological framework authorizes those claims and movements in the first place? It works in essential tandem with theory_construction_analyzer, which examines how theories are built, but focuses specifically on the epistemological foundations rather than the theoretical superstructure. It provides crucial input to inferential_commitment_mapper by revealing the epistemological commitments that cascade through any position—accept a standpoint epistemology and you inherit commitments about objectivity, evidence, and expertise that shape everything else. The engine also synergizes with concept_centrality_mapper to identify which epistemological concepts do the most work in a text, often revealing priorities the author hasn't explicitly articulated.

  Commitment to this analysis matters because epistemological bad faith is perhaps the most common intellectual failure in contemporary scholarship. Texts invoke sophisticated epistemological vocabulary—situatedness, reflexivity, positionality—while practicing exactly the universalist, disembodied knowledge-production they nominally reject. They critique the view from nowhere while writing from nowhere. They demand that others acknowledge their standpoint while treating their own as transparent. This is not necessarily hypocrisy; it's often unconscious, the result of epistemological frameworks absorbed through disciplinary training rather than chosen through reflection. Making these methods visible is the first step toward genuine epistemological responsibility: knowing what you're doing when you produce knowledge, and doing it consistently.
researcher_question: What epistemological methods does the text deploy, and how self-aware
  is it about its own knowledge-production methods?
intellectual_lineage:
  primary:
    name: haraway
    description: Donna Haraway (1944–), feminist philosopher of science whose concept
      of 'situated knowledges' provides this engine's central problematic. Against
      both objectivism (the 'god trick' of seeing everything from nowhere) and relativism
      (where all positions are equally valid), Haraway argues for partial, locatable,
      critical knowledge that takes responsibility for its own position. Her insistence
      that objectivity requires acknowledging the situatedness of the knower—that
      only partial perspectives promise objective vision—grounds this engine's detection
      of texts that claim universality while writing from particular positions, and
      its assessment of whether situatedness is genuinely inhabited or merely invoked.
  secondary:
  - name: husserl
    description: Edmund Husserl (1859–1938), founder of phenomenology, whose methodological
      innovations—the epoché (bracketing of the natural attitude), the phenomenological
      reduction, and eidetic variation—established the most rigorous tradition of
      epistemological self-reflection in modern philosophy. This engine detects whether
      texts genuinely practice phenomenological method or merely gesture toward phenomenological
      vocabulary without the demanding discipline Husserl's approach requires.
  - name: harding
    description: Sandra Harding (1935–), feminist philosopher of science who developed
      the concept of 'strong objectivity'—the argument that starting research from
      the lives of marginalized groups produces less partial and distorted accounts
      than starting from dominant positions. Her work grounds this engine's analysis
      of whose standpoint is privileged in a text and whether that privileging is
      argued for or simply assumed.
  - name: fricker
    description: Miranda Fricker (1966–), whose Epistemic Injustice (2007) identified
      testimonial injustice (prejudicial credibility deficits) and hermeneutical injustice
      (gaps in collective interpretive resources) as distinctly epistemic wrongs.
      This engine uses Fricker's framework to detect where texts address or reproduce
      epistemic injustices in their own knowledge-production practices.
  - name: quine
    description: W.V.O. Quine (1908–2000), whose 'Epistemology Naturalized' (1969)
      argued for replacing traditional epistemology's normative questions with empirical
      psychology of knowledge-acquisition. This engine detects naturalized epistemology's
      presence, often unmarked, in texts that treat knowing as a natural process while
      blurring the is/ought distinction that traditional epistemology maintained.
  - name: dewey
    description: John Dewey (1859–1952), whose pragmatist theory of inquiry rejected
      the spectator theory of knowledge in favor of understanding knowing as active
      problem-solving within a situation. This engine detects pragmatist epistemology's
      influence in texts that evaluate knowledge claims by their practical consequences
      rather than their correspondence to antecedent reality.
  traditions:
  - name: feminist_epistemology
    description: The tradition emerging from 1980s feminist critiques of science that
      challenged the ideal of value-free objectivity and developed alternative frameworks
      including standpoint theory, situated knowledges, and epistemic justice analysis.
      This tradition grounds the engine's attention to whose knowledge counts, how
      social position shapes knowing, and how epistemic practices can reproduce or
      challenge injustice.
  - name: phenomenological_tradition
    description: The philosophical tradition founded by Husserl and developed by Heidegger,
      Merleau-Ponty, and others, characterized by attention to the structures of experience
      and the methodological bracketing of assumptions about the external world. This
      tradition provides the engine's framework for detecting rigorous versus gestural
      phenomenological method in texts that invoke phenomenological vocabulary.
  - name: social_epistemology
    description: The field examining how social factors—testimony, trust, institutions,
      group inquiry—shape knowledge production. Emerging from Goldman's reliabilist
      social epistemology and diversifying through feminist and postcolonial contributions,
      this tradition grounds the engine's attention to the social dimensions of knowing
      that individualist epistemology overlooked.
  - name: pragmatist_epistemology
    description: The American philosophical tradition from Peirce through James and
      Dewey, characterized by rejection of the correspondence theory of truth, emphasis
      on the practical consequences of belief, and understanding inquiry as situated
      problem-solving. This tradition provides the engine's framework for detecting
      when texts evaluate knowledge by its fruits rather than its foundations.
  - name: critical_theory_of_knowledge
    description: The tradition from the Frankfurt School through Habermas examining
      how knowledge-production serves or challenges existing power arrangements. This
      tradition grounds the engine's attention to whose interests are served by particular
      epistemological frameworks and how knowledge-claims function ideologically.
  - name: postcolonial_epistemology
    description: The tradition examining how colonial and imperial power shaped what
      counts as knowledge, whose knowledge counts, and how epistemological frameworks
      can perpetuate colonial relations. Thinkers like Spivak, Chakrabarty, and Santos
      ground the engine's attention to the geopolitics of knowledge and the provincializing
      of Eurocentric epistemological frameworks.
  key_concepts:
  - name: epoché
    definition: Husserl's term for the suspension or bracketing of the 'natural attitude'—our
      everyday assumption that the world exists independently of our experience of
      it. The epoché is not denial of the world but methodological neutrality about
      it, enabling attention to the structures of experience itself. This engine detects
      whether texts genuinely practice epoché or merely invoke it rhetorically.
  - name: standpoint
    definition: In standpoint epistemology, the socially situated perspective from
      which knowledge is produced, shaped by one's position in structures of power
      and social relations. Standpoint is not mere perspective (everyone has that)
      but an achieved understanding of how social position shapes what can be known,
      typically requiring political consciousness and collective struggle to attain.
  - name: situated_knowledge
    definition: Haraway's term for knowledge that acknowledges its own location—the
      particular body, position, and context from which it emerges—against the 'god
      trick' of claiming to see everything from nowhere. Situated knowledge is not
      relativism but a form of objectivity achieved through explicit partiality and
      accountability for one's position.
  - name: testimonial_injustice
    definition: Fricker's term for the wrong done when a speaker receives a credibility
      deficit due to prejudice in the hearer. When testimony is discounted because
      of the speaker's race, gender, or other identity, epistemic harm is done both
      to the individual (who is wronged as a knower) and to the collective (which
      loses access to their knowledge).
  - name: hermeneutical_injustice
    definition: Fricker's term for the wrong done when someone's experiences cannot
      be understood—even by themselves—because the collective interpretive resources
      are inadequate. When the conceptual tools to make sense of an experience don't
      exist (as with sexual harassment before the term existed), those with the experience
      suffer a distinctly epistemic harm.
  - name: strong_objectivity
    definition: Harding's argument that starting research from the standpoint of marginalized
      groups produces more objective knowledge than starting from dominant positions,
      because it reveals the biases that dominant groups cannot see. Strong objectivity
      strengthens rather than abandons objectivity by making the knower's social location
      an explicit object of critical scrutiny.
  - name: reflexivity
    definition: The practice of applying one's analytical framework to one's own knowledge-production,
      acknowledging how one's method shapes what one can find. Genuine reflexivity
      produces insight into the conditions and limits of one's own knowing; performative
      reflexivity merely gestures toward self-awareness without altering practice.
  - name: naturalized_epistemology
    definition: Quine's proposal to replace traditional epistemology's normative questions
      (how ought we to arrive at beliefs?) with empirical investigation of how we
      actually do. This move dissolves the traditional is/ought distinction in epistemology,
      treating knowing as a natural phenomenon to be studied rather than a normative
      enterprise to be philosophically justified.
analytical_dimensions:
- key: phenomenological_method_deployment
  description: The extent to which a text practices phenomenological bracketing—suspending
    assumptions about the world to examine the essential structures of experience.
    This dimension assesses whether phenomenological method is rigorously applied,
    superficially invoked, or entirely absent, and whether the text's use of phenomenological
    vocabulary reflects genuine methodological commitment.
  probing_questions:
  - Where does the text bracket natural attitude assumptions to examine experiential
    structures?
  - Does the phenomenological vocabulary reflect genuine method or mere disciplinary
    signaling?
  - How rigorously is epoché practiced versus gestured toward?
  - What would a Husserlian critique of the text's phenomenological practice reveal?
  - Does the text confuse phenomenological description with empirical psychology?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note explicit phenomenological vocabulary and claimed bracketing operations
    standard: Assess whether phenomenological claims are backed by rigorous method
      and consistent practice
    deep: Evaluate the text's phenomenological practice against Husserlian standards,
      identifying where natural attitude assumptions persist despite phenomenological
      framing
- key: standpoint_positioning
  description: How the text positions itself relative to standpoint epistemology—whether
    it privileges particular social positions as epistemic resources, acknowledges
    its own standpoint, and theorizes the relationship between social location and
    knowledge. This dimension tracks both explicit standpoint claims and implicit
    assumptions about whose knowledge counts.
  probing_questions:
  - Whose standpoint does the text privilege and on what grounds?
  - Does the text acknowledge its own standpoint or write as if from nowhere?
  - How does the text theorize the relationship between social position and epistemic
    access?
  - Does the text practice Harding's strong objectivity by using marginalized standpoints
    to identify dominant biases?
  - Where does standpoint epistemology become standpoint essentialism—assuming social
    position automatically confers epistemic privilege?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Identify explicit claims about whose knowledge matters and why
    standard: Map the text's implicit standpoint hierarchy and assess whether it acknowledges
      its own position
    deep: Evaluate the text's standpoint epistemology against Harding's and Hartsock's
      criteria, identifying where it reproduces the universalism it nominally rejects
- key: situatedness_practice
  description: The degree to which the text genuinely inhabits situated knowledge
    versus merely invoking situatedness rhetorically while practicing view-from-nowhere
    writing. This dimension assesses whether acknowledgments of partiality actually
    shape the text's knowledge claims or function as inoculating gestures that license
    continued universalism.
  probing_questions:
  - Does the text's acknowledgment of situatedness actually constrain its claims?
  - Where does the text claim more than a situated knower could legitimately claim?
  - How does the text manage the tension between situatedness and generalizability?
  - Is situatedness a methodological commitment or a rhetorical gesture?
  - Does the text hold others to standards of situatedness it exempts itself from?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note explicit acknowledgments of the author's position and claims about
      partial knowledge
    standard: Assess whether situatedness claims actually shape the text's rhetoric
      and scope of claims
    deep: Identify the gap between proclaimed situatedness and actual practice, mapping
      where view-from-nowhere writing persists beneath situatedness vocabulary
- key: reflexive_depth
  description: The quality of the text's reflexive practice—whether it genuinely applies
    its own framework to itself, producing insight into its conditions and limits,
    or merely performs reflexivity as a ritual gesture. This dimension distinguishes
    reflexivity that transforms practice from reflexivity that inoculates against
    criticism.
  probing_questions:
  - Where does the text apply its own analytical categories to its own knowledge-production?
  - Does reflexivity produce genuine insight or infinite regress or performative gesture?
  - What would happen if the text's critique were applied to the text itself?
  - Where does reflexivity function to immunize the text from the very critique it
    levels at others?
  - Is the text aware of the paradoxes of reflexivity and how does it navigate them?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note explicit reflexive moments where the author acknowledges their own
      position or method
    standard: Assess whether reflexivity produces genuine methodological insight or
      functions as ritual protection
    deep: Apply the text's own framework to the text itself, identifying what it reveals
      and what the text's reflexive practice missed
- key: epistemic_justice_awareness
  description: How the text engages with questions of epistemic justice—testimonial
    credibility, hermeneutical resources, and the power dynamics of knowledge-production.
    This dimension assesses both the text's explicit analysis of epistemic injustice
    and whether its own practices reproduce the injustices it may critique.
  probing_questions:
  - Does the text address whose testimony is credited and whose is dismissed?
  - Does it identify hermeneutical gaps where experiences lack interpretive frameworks?
  - Does the text reproduce the epistemic injustices it analyzes?
  - How does the text position itself relative to the epistemic hierarchies it describes?
  - Whose voices are amplified and whose are silenced in the text's own practice?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note explicit discussions of epistemic justice, credibility, and whose
      knowledge counts
    standard: Assess whether the text's analysis of epistemic injustice is consistent
      with its own epistemic practices
    deep: Identify where the text reproduces the epistemic injustices it critiques,
      tracing the gap between its politics of knowledge and its practice of knowledge
- key: epistemological_coherence
  description: The degree to which the text's epistemological methods match its knowledge
    claims—whether a text proclaiming fallibilism asserts with certainty, whether
    a text claiming situatedness writes from nowhere, whether epistemological commitments
    are consistent across the text or shift opportunistically.
  probing_questions:
  - Does the text's epistemological framework match its actual practice of making
    claims?
  - Where does certainty of tone contradict professed fallibilism?
  - Where do different epistemological frameworks operate in different sections?
  - Does the text hold itself to the same epistemological standards it applies to
    others?
  - What epistemological framework would be required to consistently support the text's
    claims?
  depth_guidance:
    surface: Note obvious contradictions between stated epistemological position and
      rhetorical practice
    standard: Map shifts between epistemological frameworks across sections and assess
      overall consistency
    deep: Reconstruct the epistemological framework the text actually requires versus
      the one it claims, identifying the full scope of incoherence
capabilities:
- key: phenomenological_reduction_detection
  description: Identifies where texts practice or claim phenomenological bracketing
    of assumptions to examine essential structures of experience.
  extended_description: |-
    Phenomenological method, as developed by Husserl and extended by his successors, requires rigorous suspension of the natural attitude—our everyday assumption that the world exists independently of our experience. This suspension (epoché) is not skepticism about the world but methodological neutrality that enables attention to the essential structures of intentional consciousness. Many texts invoke phenomenological vocabulary without practicing phenomenological method: they claim to bracket assumptions while remaining entirely within the natural attitude, or they confuse phenomenological description with empirical psychology.

    This capability detects the difference between rigorous phenomenological practice and phenomenological gesture. It identifies where texts genuinely suspend natural attitude assumptions versus where they merely announce such suspension while continuing to make claims that presuppose it. It assesses whether phenomenological vocabulary (lifeworld, intentionality, horizon, noema) reflects genuine methodological commitment or disciplinary credential-signaling.

    The detection extends to variations within the phenomenological tradition: Husserlian transcendental phenomenology, Heideggerian existential phenomenology, Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of embodiment, and various applied phenomenologies. Each carries distinct methodological commitments that this capability tracks, assessing whether the text's phenomenological claims are consistent with the specific variant it invokes.

  description: Maps how texts position social location as epistemically significant,
    whose standpoint is privileged, and whether the text acknowledges its own standpoint.
  extended_description: |-
    Standpoint epistemology, developed by feminist theorists including Hartsock, Harding, and Collins, argues that social position shapes what can be known. Not mere perspectivalism (everyone has a perspective), standpoint theory makes the stronger claim that some social positions—particularly those of marginalized groups—afford epistemic advantages: access to knowledge that dominant positions systematically obscure. This is because those in dominant positions have interests in not seeing certain realities, while those in subordinate positions must understand both their own experience and the dominant frameworks imposed on them.

    This capability maps how texts engage with standpoint epistemology—whether explicitly or through implicit assumptions about whose knowledge matters. It identifies which standpoints are privileged and on what grounds, whether the text practices Harding's 'strong objectivity' (using marginalized standpoints to identify dominant biases), and crucially, whether the text acknowledges its own standpoint or writes as if from nowhere while requiring standpoint acknowledgment from others.

    The mapping extends to detecting standpoint essentialism—the problematic assumption that social position automatically confers epistemic privilege without the political consciousness and collective struggle that standpoint theorists argue is necessary. It also tracks how texts navigate the tension between standpoint claims and their own authority claims.

  description: Detects where texts address or reproduce testimonial injustice (credibility
    deficits) and hermeneutical injustice (interpretive gaps).
  extended_description: |-
    Miranda Fricker's identification of distinctly epistemic forms of injustice—wrongs done to persons specifically as knowers—provides a framework for analyzing how knowledge-production intersects with power. Testimonial injustice occurs when a speaker receives a credibility deficit due to prejudice: their testimony is discounted not because of its content but because of who they are. Hermeneutical injustice occurs when collective interpretive resources are inadequate to make sense of significant experiences, particularly those of marginalized groups—as when sexual harassment existed but the concept did not.

    This capability detects where texts engage with epistemic justice: whose testimony they credit and why, which experiences they have interpretive resources for, how they position themselves relative to epistemic hierarchies. But it goes further to identify where texts reproduce the very epistemic injustices they may analyze—discounting certain voices while amplifying others, assuming interpretive frameworks as universal when they are parochial, demanding epistemic recognition while denying it to others.

    The analysis includes institutional dimensions: how academic credentialing, publication hierarchies, citation practices, and disciplinary boundaries function as sites of epistemic injustice. It asks not just what a text says about epistemic justice but how its own practice instantiates or challenges epistemic hierarchies.

  description: Evaluates whether texts genuinely apply their own frameworks to themselves
    or merely perform reflexivity as ritual.
  extended_description: |-
    Reflexivity—the practice of applying one's analytical framework to one's own knowledge-production—has become a near-universal requirement in interpretive social science and humanities. But there is a vast difference between reflexivity that transforms practice and reflexivity that functions as inoculation against criticism. Performative reflexivity announces its own position and limitations, then proceeds exactly as if it had not—the acknowledgment functioning to license continued practice rather than constrain it.

    This capability assesses the quality of reflexive practice in texts. Does the text's reflexivity produce genuine insight into the conditions and limits of its own knowing? Does it change what the text claims or how it claims it? Or does reflexivity appear as a ritual gesture—a paragraph acknowledging the author's position that has no effect on the text's rhetoric, scope, or confidence? The assessment also identifies the paradoxes of reflexivity: if a text's critique of knowledge-claims applies to itself, what authorizes its own claims? How do texts navigate this without either infinite regress or self-exemption?

    Genuine reflexivity is rare and difficult. It requires applying one's own critical tools to one's own practice and being genuinely changed by what one finds. Most reflexivity in academic texts is gestural—a performance that protects the text from criticism rather than a practice that shapes it.

  description: Identifies where texts make claims about the nature of knowledge itself—what
    counts as knowledge, what validates it, what its limits are.
  extended_description: |-
    Most texts make first-order knowledge claims while assuming second-order epistemological positions they never argue for. A text might claim that certain social practices are exploitative, assuming without argument that exploitation is an objective feature detectable by properly positioned observers. Or it might argue that knowledge is always socially constructed, while assuming that this meta-claim itself is somehow exempt from construction. Meta-epistemological claims—claims about what knowledge is, how it works, who can have it, and what validates it—are the deepest layer of a text's commitments.

    This capability detects where texts make such meta-claims, whether explicitly or through assumptions embedded in their practice. It identifies the epistemological framework the text presupposes: empiricist, rationalist, pragmatist, constructivist, naturalized, phenomenological. It tracks where these frameworks conflict—often within the same text—and where first-order claims require epistemological positions the text officially rejects.

    The detection extends to claims about epistemic limits: where does the text assert the boundaries of what can be known? These limit-claims are themselves knowledge claims, raising questions about their own status. A text that claims we cannot know things-in-themselves is claiming to know something about the limits of knowledge—a claim that requires epistemological justification it rarely receives.

    The most revealing analysis of a text's epistemology often emerges from the gap between its stated methodology and its actual practice. A text may proclaim fallibilism while asserting with absolute certainty. It may claim that all knowledge is situated while writing as if from nowhere. It may demand reflexivity from others while exempting itself. It may invoke constructivism about its objects of study while assuming realism about its own claims. These contradictions are not necessarily failures of logic; they often reflect the difficulty of consistently inhabiting any epistemological position. But they are analytically significant because they reveal what the text actually assumes about knowledge, beneath its official epistemological pronouncements.

    This capability assesses overall epistemological coherence. It tracks whether epistemological commitments are consistent across the text or shift opportunistically—whether different frameworks operate in different sections, whether the text holds itself to the same standards it applies to others, whether there are systematic patterns in where coherence breaks down.

    The assessment is not simply fault-finding. Perfect epistemological coherence may be impossible, and the points of breakdown are often the most intellectually interesting moments in a text—where the demands of consistent method conflict with the requirements of saying something substantive. The goal is to make the epistemological architecture visible, including its fractures.
