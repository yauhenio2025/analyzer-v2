  What had to be true -- epistemically, institutionally, materially,
  discursively -- for these ideas to become thinkable and these
  practices possible? Every argument has a genealogy: it could only
  emerge because certain prior work laid the conceptual groundwork,
  prepared the audience, established the author's authority, and
  provided frameworks for thinking. But this same prior work also
  CONSTRAINS what can now be argued -- prior commitments bind,
  audiences have expectations, and frameworks create lock-in.

  This engine maps that landscape of possibility and constraint.
  It asks: What conditions of possibility does an author's prior
  work create for their current argument, and what paths were
  thereby foreclosed? What intellectual debts remain unacknowledged,
  and what alternative trajectories were available but not taken?

  The counterfactual is central: imagine the argument written by
  someone with no prior work history. What remains? That difference
  between the actual and the counterfactual -- that is path-dependence.

  primary:
    name: foucault
    description: 'Michel Foucault (1926-1984), French philosopher and historian of ideas whose archaeological
      and genealogical methods revealed how systems of thought emerge not from linear progress but from
      ruptures in epistemic conditions. His concept of ''conditions of possibility'' — the historical
      a priori that makes certain statements thinkable at particular moments — provides this engine''s
      foundational question: what had to be assembled (institutionally, discursively, materially) for
      an argument to become possible, and what constraints did that assembly impose on what could subsequently
      be said?'
  secondary:
  - name: quentin_skinner
    description: 'Quentin Skinner (1940-), British historian and founder of the Cambridge School contextualism,
      whose methodology demands that texts be understood through the linguistic and ideological conventions
      available to their authors at the moment of writing. His insistence that we recover what an author
      could have meant — not what later interpreters wish they meant — provides this engine''s counterfactual
      discipline, while his concept of ''rhetorical redescription'' shows how intellectual innovation occurs
      within inherited vocabularies, helping the engine identify moments where prior conceptual commitments
      both enable new arguments and constrain them by binding the author to audiences and frameworks that
      limit radical departure.'
  - name: arthur_lovejoy
    description: Arthur O. Lovejoy (1873-1962), American philosopher and founder of the history of ideas,
      who traced 'unit-ideas' across centuries to reveal hidden continuities and constraints in philosophical
      argument. His method of isolating conceptual building blocks — showing how complex arguments depend
      on prior, often unexamined assumptions — informs this engine's technique of decomposing an author's
      current position into debts to their earlier work, revealing the genealogical sediment beneath present
      claims.
  traditions:
  - name: archaeology
    description: 'Foucauldian archaeology excavates the rules that govern what can be said in a given
      epoch, identifying discontinuities in discursive formations rather than tracing smooth development.
      For this engine, archaeology provides a method for identifying the epistemic conditions an author
      inherits from their own prior work: the conceptual grids, taxonomies, and problem-spaces that structure
      what arguments become formulable and what questions can be asked.'
  - name: genealogy
    description: 'Foucauldian genealogy traces how present arrangements emerged through contingent struggle,
      accident, and power rather than necessity or progress, emphasizing the paths not taken and possibilities
      foreclosed. This tradition equips the engine to ask counterfactual questions: what alternative trajectories
      were available at each stage of an author''s intellectual development, and how did choices made
      in earlier work constrain or enable later argumentation?'
  - name: critical_theory
    description: 'Critical theory, from the Frankfurt School through contemporary variants, interrogates
      the hidden social and institutional conditions that shape knowledge production, asking whose interests
      are served by particular framings. This tradition directs the engine to examine not just conceptual
      but material and institutional conditions: how an author''s position, audience, and disciplinary
      location structure what arguments are possible and which remain unthinkable.'
  - name: cambridge_school
    description: The Cambridge School of intellectual history, developed by Skinner and Pocock, demands
      rigorous historical contextualization by reconstructing the linguistic conventions, rhetorical moves,
      and ideological debates available to historical actors. For this engine, the Cambridge School provides
      methodological discipline for distinguishing what an author's prior work actually made possible
      from anachronistic attributions, insisting that intellectual possibilities be mapped through available
      vocabularies and acknowledged commitments.
  - name: path_dependence_theory
    description: 'Path dependence theory, borrowed from institutional economics and science studies, demonstrates
      how early choices create increasing returns and lock-in effects, making certain trajectories self-reinforcing
      while foreclosing alternatives. This tradition provides the engine with a framework for analyzing
      how an author''s prior conceptual investments create momentum: established vocabularies attract
      audiences, prior positions bind future commitments, and accumulated authority makes certain moves
      possible while rendering others strategically unavailable.'
  key_concepts:
  - name: episteme
    definition: The underlying epistemological configuration that determines, in a given period and domain,
      what counts as knowledge, what problems are recognizable, and what methods are legitimate. The engine
      uses this to map the epistemic field an author's prior work has constructed for their current argument
      — the implicit rules governing what can be said.
  - name: dispositif
    definition: A heterogeneous apparatus linking discourses, institutions, architectural forms, regulations,
      and practices into a strategic network that produces particular effects. The engine deploys this
      to trace how an author's prior institutional positions, publication venues, and audience relationships
      form a material-discursive apparatus shaping what arguments are possible.
  - name: discursive_formation
    definition: A system of rules that defines what statements are recognizable, valid, and related within
      a domain, determining which objects can appear and which speaking positions are authorized. The
      engine uses this to identify how an author's earlier work establishes a discursive formation that
      both legitimates and constrains their current intervention.
  - name: conditions_of_possibility
    definition: 'The ensemble of prerequisites — conceptual, institutional, material, discursive — that
      must be in place for a particular statement, practice, or argument to become thinkable and utterable.
      This is the engine''s central analytical target: what conditions did the author''s prior work create
      that make the current argument possible?'
  - name: path_dependence
    definition: The process by which early choices generate self-reinforcing effects that constrain future
      options, creating lock-in even when alternatives might be superior. The engine uses this to analyze
      how an author's prior conceptual commitments create momentum and constraint, making certain argumentative
      moves natural while foreclosing others.
  - name: intellectual_toolkit
    definition: The accumulated repertoire of concepts, methods, rhetorical strategies, and frameworks
      an author has developed through prior work, which becomes both resource and constraint for new arguments.
      The engine inventories this toolkit to determine what the current argument inherits and what it
      must work around.
  - name: counterfactual_analysis
    definition: 'The methodological practice of imagining alternative scenarios — arguments by authors
      without particular prior commitments, or trajectories where different choices were made — to isolate
      the causal effect of specific conditions. The engine uses counterfactuals to measure what the author''s
      prior work specifically contributes: the difference between what was written and what could have
      been.'

- key: map_enabling_conditions
  description: Identify and classify the epistemic, institutional, material, and discursive preconditions
    that make an argument thinkable
  produces_dimensions:
  - enabling_conditions
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability performs archaeological excavation of the conceptual, institutional, and discursive preconditions that render an argument intelligible and credible within its moment. Following Foucault's archaeological method, it asks not merely "what influenced this work?" but rather "what had to already be in place—as tacit knowledge, methodological habits, audience preparation, institutional authorization—for this argument to be thinkable at all?" It maps the epistemic terrain that the author inherits, identifying which frameworks are presupposed rather than argued for, which problems are treated as given rather than constructed, and which conceptual resources are simply available in the intellectual atmosphere.

    This capability establishes the baseline for all other analyses in the engine. Without identifying what was already possible, we cannot detect what is genuinely constraining (detect_constraints), trace how possibilities accumulated over time (trace_path_dependence), or separate inheritance from innovation (explore_counterfactuals). It provides the positive conditions against which path-dependence becomes visible as constraint rather than simply influence. The enabling conditions function as the field of emergence from which the argument arises.

    The sophistication of this capability lies in distinguishing between levels of necessity. Some conditions are critical—remove them and the argument becomes literally unintelligible. Others are supporting—they make the argument easier or more credible but not strictly necessary. A naive version simply lists influences; a sophisticated version maps essentiality, evidence of actual reliance, and the author's relationship to each condition (acknowledged dependency, implicit presupposition, strategic instrumentalization, or outright denial). It captures how conditions from disparate domains—a methodological habit from one field, a metaphor from another, an institutional platform from a third—combine to create a unique landscape of thinkability.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: foucault
    concept: episteme
    method: Foucault's archaeological method examines not what authors consciously intended but what system
      of thought made their statements possible—the rules of formation that determine what can be said,
      who can say it, and how it acquires truth-value. This capability applies that method to trace the
      historical a priori that conditions an argument.
  indicators:
  - Author employs technical vocabulary without definition, suggesting reader familiarity from prior work
  - Argument begins mid-conversation, presupposing resolution of debates the author previously engaged
  - Methodological moves are executed without justification, as if naturalized through repetition
  - Author's institutional position or prior publications are invoked as authorization for claims
  - Conceptual frameworks appear fully formed rather than being constructed within the text
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Identifies 3-5 most obvious enabling conditions (prior conceptual work, audience preparation,
      established authority) with brief descriptions of each.
    standard: Maps enabling conditions with essentiality ratings (critical/important/supporting), specific
      textual evidence showing reliance, and assessment of author's management strategy (acknowledged/implicit/denied/instrumentalized).
    deep: Full archaeological analysis of the ensemble of enabling conditions, their mutual dependencies,
      how they constitute a coherent intellectual toolkit, tracking conditions from multiple fields and
      indirect sources operating below conscious awareness, revealing the complete landscape of thinkability.
- key: detect_constraints
  description: Identify binding prior commitments and assess their force
  produces_dimensions:
  - constraining_conditions
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability identifies the binding force of prior commitments—the ways an author's intellectual history limits what can now be credibly argued without self-contradiction, audience alienation, or loss of hard-won authority. It recognizes that every enabling condition is simultaneously constraining: the conceptual vocabulary that makes an argument possible also determines what can be said within it; the audience trained to accept certain premises will resist departures; the methodological habits that produced past success become difficult to abandon. Drawing on path-dependence theory, this capability maps how prior investments create switching costs and lock-in effects in intellectual work.

    Where map_enabling_conditions identifies positive preconditions, detect_constraints reveals their negative corollary—what paths are now foreclosed or prohibitively costly. This operates in dynamic tension with map_alternative_paths (which asks what else could have been argued) and directly feeds explore_counterfactuals (which measures how much current argument is determined by constraint vs. free choice). Constraints function as the mechanism of path-dependence: they're how past positions accumulate into present limitations. Without detecting constraints, we might mistake strategic choice for genuine innovation or fail to see where an author is trapped by their own history.

    Sophistication lies in assessing binding force and navigation strategies. Some constraints are absolute—contradicting a core prior claim would destroy credibility entirely. Others are negotiable—they can be worked around, reframed, or acknowledged and transcended. A naive reading sees only the current argument; a sophisticated analysis detects where the author is clearly managing a constraint, perhaps through strategic silence, rhetorical hedging, or careful repositioning that maintains continuity while enabling movement.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: path_dependence_theory
    concept: lock-in
    method: Path-dependence theory, particularly from institutional economics, shows how prior choices
      create increasing returns that make switching costly. Applied to intellectual history, it reveals
      how theoretical commitments, methodological investments, and reputational positions create lock-in
      effects that constrain subsequent argument paths even when alternatives might be superior.
  indicators:
  - Author carefully hedges or qualifies claims that might contradict prior positions
  - Conspicuous silence on topics the author previously addressed with different conclusions
  - Defensive footnotes acknowledging but minimizing departures from earlier work
  - Argumentative contortions to maintain consistency with a framework the author has elsewhere defended
  - Appeals to audience expectations or community standards that limit argumentative options
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Identifies 2-3 strongest constraints with assessment of binding force (strong/moderate/weak).
    standard: Maps constraints with binding force ratings and detailed analysis of how the author navigates
      each (directly addresses/works around/ignores/reframes), including textual evidence of navigation
      strategies.
    deep: Analyzes the complete constraint landscape including constraint interactions, comprehensive
      taxonomy of navigation strategies employed, and assessment of whether each constraint is productive
      (forcing rigor and coherence) or limiting (preventing intellectual growth).
- key: trace_path_dependence
  description: Map causal chains of intellectual accumulation from prior to current work
  produces_dimensions:
  - path_dependencies
  requires_dimensions:
  - enabling_conditions
  - constraining_conditions
  extended_description: |-
    This capability constructs causal chains showing how intellectual positions accumulate over time, such that premises in work N are actually inherited conclusions from work N-3, which themselves depended on frameworks established in work N-5. It performs genealogical analysis in Foucault's sense—not tracing continuous development but rather showing how positions that appear natural or inevitable in the current work are actually contingent products of a specific intellectual trajectory. The goal is to make visible the archaeology of the present: to reveal that what seems like a starting premise is actually an endpoint of prior reasoning, now sedimented into unexamined foundation.

    This capability synthesizes the outputs of map_enabling_conditions and detect_constraints by showing how they emerged historically. It answers the question: how did these particular enabling conditions and constraints come to exist for this author? Path-dependence chains explain why certain arguments are available (because prior work laid groundwork) and why others are unavailable (because prior commitments bind). These chains directly feed explore_counterfactuals, which uses them to imagine what would remain if key links were absent. Without tracing path-dependence, we see only a synchronic snapshot; with it, we understand the diachronic accumulation that makes the current argument possible.

    The sophistication lies in distinguishing acknowledged from hidden dependency chains and assessing their necessity. Some chains are explicit—the author says "building on my prior work on X." Others are invisible—premises that seem self-evident but are actually conclusions from prior arguments the author no longer remembers making. A sophisticated analysis tracks how chains from different works intersect and reinforce, creating increasingly rigid structures, and tests counterfactually which links are load-bearing (remove them and the argument collapses) versus ornamental.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: foucault
    concept: genealogy
    method: Foucault's genealogical method traces how present configurations emerged from contingent historical
      processes rather than logical necessity. Applied here, it shows how current arguments descend from
      prior positions through accumulation and sedimentation, revealing path-dependence where linear intellectual
      history sees development or progress.
  indicators:
  - Current argument treats as premise what prior work established as conclusion
  - Technical terms whose meaning was defined in earlier works are used without redefinition
  - Author references 'as I have shown elsewhere' suggesting inherited rather than fresh argument
  - Conceptual frameworks appear without justification because they were justified in prior publications
  - Methodological choices that make sense only given the author's specific intellectual trajectory
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Identifies 1-2 most significant dependency chains with brief description of the sequence.
    standard: Maps major dependency chains showing the sequence of works and positions involved, with
      assessment of whether chains are acknowledged or hidden.
    deep: Full path analysis of all significant chains, their acknowledgment status, how chains from different
      works mutually reinforce, and detailed counterfactual analysis of what the argument would look like
      if key links were removed.
- key: reveal_debts
  description: Surface unacknowledged intellectual borrowings and hypothesize reasons
  produces_dimensions:
  - unacknowledged_debts
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability surfaces intellectual borrowings from the author's own prior work that remain unacknowledged in the current text—cases where ideas, frameworks, or arguments developed earlier are presented as new, or where their origins are strategically obscured. This is not about detecting plagiarism but about mapping the relationship between an author and their own intellectual history. Following the Cambridge School's emphasis on recovering authorial intention and rhetorical strategy, this capability asks: what does the author gain by concealing these debts? The reasons range from innocent (the author no longer remembers the origin) to strategic (claiming novelty to attract attention, distancing from earlier positions now seen as problematic, or simplifying the genealogy for narrative clarity).

    This capability operates in tension with trace_path_dependence. Where path-dependence is about causal chains (A led to B led to C), debts are about borrowings that may not be causal dependencies but are nonetheless appropriations. An author might borrow a fully-formed idea from their own work without that idea being causally necessary to the current argument—it's a debt without being a dependency. Revealing debts enriches the picture painted by map_enabling_conditions by showing which enabling conditions the author wants readers to see versus those they prefer to obscure. It feeds into synthesize_judgment by providing evidence about the author's self-awareness and intellectual honesty.

    Sophistication lies in distinguishing between types of non-acknowledgment and assessing their implications. Sometimes the debt is simply to vocabulary or methodology that the author reasonably considers their own ongoing toolkit. Other times, substantive positions are recycled under new labels. A sophisticated analysis not only identifies what is owed but hypothesizes why the debt is hidden (embarrassment about prior position, desire to appear innovative, strategic distancing) and considers how making the debt explicit would change the argument's reception.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: quentin_skinner
    concept: rhetorical_strategy
    method: Skinner's contextualist method examines what an author was doing in making an argument—what
      rhetorical moves were being executed, what positions were being contested. This capability applies
      that lens to ask what an author gains rhetorically by obscuring connections to their own prior work,
      treating non-acknowledgment as a strategic choice worth interpreting.
  indicators:
  - Ideas presented as novel that appear substantially similar to claims in prior works
  - Shifts in terminology that rebrand rather than reconceptualize earlier positions
  - Arguments structured around frameworks developed elsewhere without citation to the original development
  - Current work claims to break new ground in areas the author has previously published on without acknowledgment
  - Omission of self-citation at points where the author's prior work is directly relevant
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Notes any obvious unacknowledged borrowings from prior work with brief description.
    standard: Identifies specific debts with textual evidence from both current and prior work, and hypothesizes
      reasons for non-acknowledgment (embarrassment/oversight/novelty claim/strategic distancing).
    deep: 'Maps the complete debt structure: what is owed, to which specific prior works, comprehensive
      evidence, likely reasons for concealment including psychological and strategic factors, and detailed
      assessment of how acknowledgment would change the argument''s reception and credibility.'

  description: Identify branching points and paths not taken
  produces_dimensions:
  - alternative_paths
  requires_dimensions:
  - enabling_conditions
  - constraining_conditions
  extended_description: |-
    This capability identifies branching points in the author's intellectual trajectory where different argumentative paths were genuinely available, and analyzes why the path taken was chosen over alternatives. It reconstructs the decision space at key moments—not to second-guess the author but to understand what made certain moves more available or attractive given the resources (conceptual, institutional, audience-related) at hand. This is fundamentally about contingency: showing that the current argument is not the inevitable product of prior work but rather one selection from a field of possibilities, chosen because it aligned with certain resources, affordances, or incentives.

    This capability directly complements detect_constraints by showing what was constrained (which paths were foreclosed or costly) and what remained genuinely open. It enriches explore_counterfactuals by providing concrete alternatives to the path taken—not just the abstract "imagine someone with no history" but the specific "imagine this author had chosen the other fork at this branching point." These alternative paths reveal both the flexibility and the determinism in intellectual work: some choices are substantially free; others are heavily weighted by prior commitments, audience expectations, or institutional pressures. Mapping them shows where author agency operates versus where path-dependence dominates.

    Sophistication involves distinguishing between genuine branching points and illusory ones. Some apparent alternatives were never really viable given the author's commitments or position. A sophisticated analysis identifies only those points where real choice existed, reconstructs the decision criteria (what resources favored which path), and develops detailed counterfactual scenarios showing how the current argument would differ if the other path had been taken. It may reveal that certain key features of the current argument—presented as necessary or inevitable—actually resulted from contingent choices at these branch points.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: quentin_skinner
    concept: available_moves
    method: Skinner's contextualism emphasizes that authors operate within a repertoire of available moves
      constrained by linguistic and conceptual conventions of their time. This capability applies that
      insight diachronically to an author's own corpus, asking what moves were available at each stage
      and why certain ones were selected over alternatives.
  indicators:
  - Author explicitly considers and rejects alternative positions that could have been developed from
    prior work
  - Significant shifts in emphasis or focus between works suggesting choices about what threads to pursue
  - Theoretical frameworks adopted that foreclose other frameworks previously available
  - Responses to critics that reveal paths the author chose not to take
  - Disciplinary or institutional migrations that opened new paths while closing others
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Identifies 1-2 major branching points where different argumentative paths were available.

    This capability executes the engine's central thought experiment: imagining the current argument written by someone with no prior work history, no accumulated intellectual capital, no path-dependent constraints. What remains under this counterfactual is genuine innovation—ideas that emerged in the current work rather than being inherited. What disappears is path-dependent inheritance—frameworks, premises, authority, audience preparation that exist only because of prior work. The goal is to separate the novel from the accumulated, measuring what proportion of the argument's intellectual content and rhetorical force derives from the author's specific trajectory versus what could exist independently of that history.

    This capability synthesizes outputs from map_enabling_conditions (what heritage exists to potentially remove), detect_constraints (what bindings might not exist in the counterfactual), trace_path_dependence (which dependency chains to imaginatively sever), and map_alternative_paths (what might have been argued instead). It's the engine's most ambitious analytical move because it attempts to measure something inherently unmeasurable: the magnitude of path-dependence. The counterfactual reveals not just that prior work matters but how much it matters—whether the current argument is 80% inheritance and 20% innovation or the reverse.

    Sophistication lies in specificity and honesty about uncertainty. A naive counterfactual vaguely suggests "much would be different." A sophisticated analysis identifies specific passages, arguments, or frameworks that would have to be removed or radically altered in the counterfactual scenario, estimates the proportion of content that is novel versus inherited, and crucially, assesses whether the path-dependence is productive (adding depth, coherence, and authority) or limiting (trapping the author in outdated frameworks or constraining innovation). The analysis must grapple with the fundamental difficulty that we cannot truly know what an author would argue without their history—but attempting the thought experiment still yields insights.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: path_dependence_theory
    concept: counterfactual_analysis
    method: Path-dependence theory uses counterfactual reasoning to assess the causal impact of historical
      contingencies. By imagining a world where the contingent event didn't occur and comparing outcomes,
      we can measure the magnitude of path-dependence. This capability applies that method to intellectual
      history, asking what would remain without the contingent fact of this author's specific prior work.
  indicators:
  - Arguments that presuppose conceptual frameworks without establishing them
  - Claims that draw authority from the author's prior work or reputation rather than independent argument
  - Technical vocabulary whose meaning depends on prior definitional work
  - Positions that make sense only as developments of or responses to the author's earlier claims
  - Audience preparation that enables compressed argument unavailable to someone writing ab initio
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Brief counterfactual identifying what is most obviously path-dependent versus what could
      exist independently of prior work.
    standard: 2-3 paragraph counterfactual analysis separating genuine innovation from inherited intellectual
      capital, with examples of each and rough proportion estimates.
    deep: Comprehensive counterfactual with specific examples of what changes in each section of the argument,
      detailed proportion estimates of novel versus inherited content, and evaluative assessment of whether
      the path-dependence is productive (depth/coherence) or limiting (constraint/obsolescence).

  description: Identify intellectual toolkits imported from other fields that operate below conscious
    awareness
  produces_dimensions:
  - cross_domain_transfers
  requires_dimensions: []
  extended_description: |-
    This capability identifies intellectual toolkits imported from fields outside the author's primary discipline that shape thinking below the level of conscious argument—frameworks, metaphors, methodological habits, or problem-formulations borrowed from other domains that function as cognitive infrastructure. Drawing on the sociology of knowledge and cognitive science of analogy, it recognizes that training in any field installs not just knowledge but ways of knowing: an economist doesn't just learn supply and demand curves but acquires an optimization mindset; a physicist doesn't just learn mechanics but internalizes mathematical modeling as the form knowledge takes. When an author brings these transfered frameworks to a new field, they create both unique insights (seeing problems no one else sees) and systematic blind spots (being unable to see what the framework can't capture).

    This capability operates below the level of explicit citation or acknowledged influence. Where reveal_debts finds unacknowledged borrowings from the author's own prior work, detect_cross_domain_transfers finds transferred cognitive structures from entirely different domains—often so deeply internalized that the author doesn't recognize them as imported rather than natural. These transfers function as enabling conditions (they make certain arguments thinkable) and constraints (they make others unthinkable), thus connecting to both map_enabling_conditions and detect_constraints. They're particularly important for explore_counterfactuals because removing them would fundamentally alter not just the content but the style and structure of argument.

    Sophistication involves making the invisible visible—detecting frameworks so naturalized that neither author nor audience registers them as transferred. A naive reading takes the author's analytical approach as simply "how one thinks about this topic." A sophisticated analysis recognizes the disciplinary signature: this is how a lawyer/economist/biologist/engineer thinks, and that framework has been imported into a different domain. It assesses both the blind spots created (what the framework literally cannot see) and the unique insights enabled (what only this framework makes visible), and crucially, whether the author is aware of the transfer or operates within it unconsciously.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: arthur_lovejoy
    concept: unit-ideas
    method: Lovejoy's history of ideas traces how fundamental conceptual units migrate across disciplines
      and periods, taking on new meanings in new contexts. This capability applies that insight to track
      how methodological frameworks and cognitive habits—not just ideas—transfer between fields in an
      individual author's work, shaping argument below the level of conscious awareness.
  indicators:
  - Characteristic problem-formulations from another discipline appear in the author's argument structure
  - Metaphors or analogies drawn systematically from a specific field outside the primary discipline
  - Methodological moves that are standard in another field but novel or unusual in the current domain
  - Author's training or career history includes significant time in a different discipline
  - Analytical framework that assumes features of phenomena that are true in one domain but questionable
    in another
  depth_scaling:
    surface: Notes any obvious cross-domain influences or frameworks imported from other fields.

      and how it shapes the current argument's structure or conclusions.

  - enabling_conditions
  - constraining_conditions
  - counterfactual_analysis
  extended_description: |-
    This capability produces the engine's overall verdict: whether the author's intellectual biography is, on balance, more enabling or more constraining for the current argument, whether the author manages their relationship to their own history productively, and whether path-dependence functions as a source of depth or as an intellectual trap. It synthesizes evidence from all other capabilities—the enabling conditions that make argument possible, the constraints that limit it, the path-dependencies that accumulate over time, the unacknowledged debts that reveal self-awareness or lack thereof, the alternative paths that show what was foreclosed, the counterfactuals that measure genuine innovation, and the transferred frameworks that operate below awareness. The judgment is not merely descriptive (here's what happened) but evaluative (here's whether it worked).

    This synthesis addresses the engine's core problematique: every argument has a genealogy that both enables and constrains. The question is whether the author achieves productive relationship with that genealogy or is imprisoned by it. A productive relationship involves: acknowledging debts and dependencies honestly, leveraging accumulated intellectual capital while remaining open to genuine innovation, managing constraints through creative navigation rather than denial, and maintaining awareness of one's own frameworks and their limits. An unproductive relationship involves: being trapped by prior commitments, presenting inheritance as innovation, remaining unconscious of constraining frameworks, or allowing path-dependence to foreclose intellectual growth.

    Sophistication lies in specificity and actionability. A naive synthesis offers bland assessment: "the author draws effectively on prior work." A sophisticated judgment provides specific evidence for its verdict, identifies particular moments where the author manages or fails to manage their history productively, assesses whether the author appears aware of their path-dependence (and whether awareness helps or hinders), and crucially, offers concrete recommendations: what would this author need to do differently to escape unproductive constraints or leverage enabling conditions more effectively? It may also identify implications for the field: whether this pattern of path-dependence is idiosyncratic or symptomatic of broader disciplinary dynamics.
  intellectual_grounding:
    thinker: foucault
    concept: genealogy
    method: Foucault's genealogical approach assesses not just how we arrived at present configurations
      but whether they serve or constrain us—whether inherited structures are productive or demand transformation.
      This capability applies that evaluative dimension to ask whether an author's relationship to their
      own intellectual history is productive or limiting, and what transformation might be needed.
  indicators:
  - Moments where the author clearly struggles with or navigates a constraint from prior work
  - Evidence of self-awareness or lack thereof regarding path-dependencies and transferred frameworks
  - Patterns across the corpus showing either growth beyond constraints or increasing rigidity
  - The author's explicit reflections on their own intellectual development (if any)
  - Comparison of early and late work showing trajectory toward greater or lesser constraint
  depth_scaling:
    surface: One-paragraph judgment on whether intellectual biography is primarily enabling or constraining.
    standard: 2-3 paragraph assessment with specific evidence, covering whether the author manages their
      history productively, whether they're aware of path-dependence, and what the balance of enabling
      versus constraining looks like.
    deep: Comprehensive assessment with detailed evidence from all dimensions, specific recommendations
      for what the author would need to do differently to escape unproductive constraints or leverage
      productive ones more effectively, and analysis of implications for the field (whether this pattern
