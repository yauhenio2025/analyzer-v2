The capability distinguishes between explicit citation (where continuity is asserted), silent borrowing (where the debt is concealed), and unconscious absorption (where the author may not recognize their own influence on themselves).

The capability distinguishes strategic mutations (serving the current argument's needs) from drift (accidental semantic slippage over time), a distinction central to understanding authorial agency in self-genealogy.\n\nSemantic mutations are the mechanism by which appropriation happens: you cannot assess appropriation fidelity without knowing what semantic changes occurred.
