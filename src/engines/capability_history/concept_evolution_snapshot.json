When an author shifts from mechanical metaphors (systems, mechanisms, functions) to organic metaphors (growth, evolution, ecology), or from spatial metaphors (boundaries, territories, positions) to temporal metaphors (development, trajectories, genealogies), the shift signals a transformation in the underlying ontology of their thought. The capability distinguishes governing metaphors (pervasive structural mappings that organize entire domains of thought) from occasional analogies, and tracks metaphor lifecycles: birth (new source domain introduced), elaboration (existing metaphor extended to new entailments), competition (multiple metaphors for the same concept), replacement (one source domain supplants another), and literalization (dead metaphors that become technical vocabulary).\n\nMetaphor analysis reveals intellectual continuities that vocabulary and methodology tracking miss.

The capability provides the synthetic view required for downstream engines to assess appropriation tactics (did the author genuinely engage with the prior work or merely harvest vocabulary?) and to evaluate intellectual honesty (are claimed breakthroughs genuine reconceptualizations or rebranded continuities?). The challenge is avoiding false positives where apparent coupling is coincidental, and false negatives where genuine coupling is obscured by complex mediating factors. A naive synthesis reports change/stability in each dimension independently; a sophisticated synthesis identifies second-order patterns in how dimensions interact, revealing the author's characteristic pathways of conceptual change.",

When the same word appears in two texts\nseparated by years, it rarely means the same thing. Concepts are\nliving entities: they are born, mutate, merge, split, and sometimes\ndie -- replaced by successors that carry traces of their ancestors.\n\nThis engine performs multi-dimensional comparison between a prior work\nand the current work's profile (established in Pass 1). It does not\nmerely track whether a concept appears in both places. It asks: has\nthe VOCABULARY shifted -- are the same terms used, or have new terms\nreplaced old ones? Has the METHODOLOGY changed -- does the author\nargue for the same ideas using different evidence or analytical moves?\nHave the METAPHORS evolved -- are the same images deployed, or have\nthey been abandoned for new ones? Has the FRAMING changed -- was\nsomething once tentative now presented as axiomatic?\n\nThese four dimensions -- vocabulary, methodology, metaphor, framing --\nconstitute the engine's analytical lens. Each dimension can reveal\ngenealogical connections invisible to the others. Two works may share\nno vocabulary but identical methodological signatures (foundational\ninfluence). A concept may retain its name but undergo complete metaphor\nreplacement (deep reconceptualization masked by terminological continuity).\n\nThis is the FIRST engine in the prior work scanning chain (Pass 2).\nIt runs once per prior work, producing per-work dimensional comparisons\nthat feed into concept_appropriation_tracker and downstream synthesis.\n",
