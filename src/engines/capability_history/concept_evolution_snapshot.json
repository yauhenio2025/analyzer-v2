When an author shifts from mechanical metaphors (systems, mechanisms, functions) to organic metaphors (growth, evolution, ecology), or from spatial metaphors (boundaries, territories, positions) to temporal metaphors (development, trajectories, genealogies), the shift signals a transformation in the underlying ontology of their thought. The capability distinguishes governing metaphors (pervasive structural mappings that organize entire domains of thought) from occasional analogies, and tracks metaphor lifecycles: birth (new source domain introduced), elaboration (existing metaphor extended to new entailments), competition (multiple metaphors for the same concept), replacement (one source domain supplants another), and literalization (dead metaphors that become technical vocabulary).\n\nMetaphor analysis reveals intellectual continuities that vocabulary and methodology tracking miss.
