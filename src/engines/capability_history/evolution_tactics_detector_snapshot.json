  "problematique": "When authors write across many years, they inevitably change their\nminds. But they rarely just SAY \"I changed my mind.\" Instead, they\nemploy a repertoire of intellectual self-management tactics --\nstrategies for handling the relationship between what they said before\nand what they say now. These tactics are not necessarily dishonest;\nthey are often unconscious, sometimes strategic, and always revealing.\n\nThis engine detects 10 recurring tactics:\n\nCONCEPTUAL RECYCLING: Reusing old arguments in new frameworks where\nthey serve different functions -- same building materials, different\nbuilding. SILENT REVISION: Changing position without acknowledgment,\nwriting as if the new view was always held. STRATEGIC ESCALATION:\nPromoting tentative prior claims to established facts without new\nevidence. FRAMEWORK MIGRATION: Moving concepts between theoretical\nhomes without justifying the transplant. STRATEGIC AMNESIA:\nSelectively forgetting inconvenient prior commitments. VOCABULARY\nLAUNDERING: Renaming concepts to shed unwanted associations -- the\nsame idea reappears under a new name, severed from its problematic\nhistory. AUTHORITY BOOTSTRAPPING: Leveraging credibility earned from\ncareful prior work to legitimize current speculative claims.\nHEDGING RECLASSIFICATION: Retroactively qualifying past claims as\nmore tentative than they actually were, creating room for the current\nposition. COMPLEXITY SHIELDING: Burying contradictions between prior\nand current positions in layers of complexity so they are difficult\nto detect. LEGACY MANAGEMENT: Actively curating one's intellectual\nhistory -- selectively citing earlier work, reframing past positions,\nconstructing a narrative of purposeful development where the actual\ntrajectory was more reactive.\n\nThe analytical stance is Goffman's: we are watching impression\nmanagement applied to intellectual identity. The author is performing\na self that has a coherent intellectual history, and the tactics are\nthe dramaturgical techniques of that performance. Bourdieu adds the\ndimension of cultural capital -- these tactics are strategies for\nmaintaining and deploying accumulated intellectual credibility.\nKuhn provides the framework for understanding why tactics cluster\naround certain moments: paradigm shifts within an author's own work\ncreate the most intense need for self-management.\n\nEvery detection must be VERIFIABLE -- grounded in specific vocabulary\nevidence, framing evidence, and methodological evidence from both\nearlier and later works. The engine does not make impressionistic\njudgments; it builds evidence-based cases for each tactic instance.\n",
