It constructs the complete network of meaning-relations for each significant concept by identifying not what a term points to in the world, but what other terms it is defined against, clustered with, and distinguished from. For every concept like 'power,' it asks: what does the author treat as a near-synonym (influence, force, domination)? What stands in contrast (weakness, submission, anarchy)? What broader category does it belong to (social relations, political phenomena)? What specific forms does it take (coercive power, discursive power, economic power)?

This is the work of recovering the langue\u2014the system of differences\u2014that makes any particular parole meaningful.\n\nWithout this capability, downstream engines operate on isolated definitions rather than living meanings. The concept_cluster identification needs these relationship networks to understand what holds clusters together. The boundary analysis needs them to know where concepts meet and potentially blur.

The connotation mapping needs them to distinguish between semantic relations (which are structural) and affective associations (which are rhetorical).

Drawing on Rosch's prototype theory, it recognizes that semantic organization is not flat but structured around cores and peripheries: some concepts are central exemplars of a cluster (the prototype) while others are marginal members. A cluster around 'rationality' might include 'calculation,' 'optimization,' and 'means-ends reasoning' as core members, with 'deliberation' and 'judgment' as more peripheral participants that bridge to other clusters. These clusters often correspond to theoretical traditions, disciplinary formations, or conceptual schemes the author has inherited or synthesized.\n\nThis capability transforms the flat semantic field maps into a three-dimensional landscape with peaks, valleys, and ridges.

For downstream engines, these clusters provide the semantic architecture against which inferential commitments and argumentative patterns will be analyzed. The boundary analysis needs clusters to know which boundaries matter most (those between major clusters). The usage tracking needs them to detect when a concept is being pulled between different cluster orbits, shifting its meaning.\n\nThe sophistication lies in recognizing that clusters are not simply topics or subjects.

A sophisticated approach identifies clusters by actual semantic behavior\u2014which concepts genuinely co-vary in usage, share collocations, and reinforce each other's meanings, regardless of how the author explicitly organizes chapters or sections.

Wittgenstein's attention to how concepts have blurred edges rather than sharp definitions, and how this fuzziness is often essential to their functioning, grounds this analysis. When an author uses both 'power' and 'influence,' where exactly does one end and the other begin? Is the boundary sharp and explicitly theorized, or is it left deliberately vague? Does the author sometimes slide between the terms as if they were interchangeable, and other times insist on their difference? These boundary behaviors are not defects to be corrected but phenomena to be documented, because they reveal what distinctions matter to the author's argument and what conflations it depends upon.\n\nBoundary analysis is where semantic field mapping becomes diagnostic of argumentative strategy. Many texts derive their analytical leverage precisely from how they draw boundaries differently than predecessors. A theorist who sharply distinguishes 'power' from 'authority' where others conflate them is making a theoretical claim through semantic stipulation. Conversely, an author who strategically leaves boundaries fuzzy may be preserving argumentative flexibility\u2014able to invoke the connotations of both concepts without committing to their distinction. This capability identifies which boundaries are weight-bearing for the argument (where a shift in boundary would change the conclusion) and which are ornamental. It feeds the inferential commitment mapper by identifying which conceptual distinctions carry logical commitments and which are merely nominal.\n\nSophistication requires distinguishing acknowledged fuzziness from unacknowledged confusion. Wittgenstein's notion of family resemblance legitimizes certain kinds of conceptual blurriness\u2014some concepts genuinely have no essence and their boundaries are necessarily vague. But other boundary problems reflect unresolved tensions or equivocations.

The gap between definition and usage is often where a concept's real meaning emerges. An author might define 'rationality' abstractly as 'goal-oriented reasoning,' but consistently use it in contexts that imply calculative, means-ends reasoning specifically, never applying it to forms of practical wisdom or deliberation.

It identifies contexts of heavy use (where the concept does the most argumentative work) and conspicuous absence (where you would expect the concept but the author avoids it, suggesting limitations or tensions). It distinguishes between constructive and critical deployment: Does the author use 'ideology' only when criticizing others, never when describing their own framework? That asymmetry is itself meaningful. For downstream engines, usage profiles provide the empirical reality check against which stated commitments can be tested.

Lakoff's work on conceptual metaphors and framing reveals how much of political and analytical language carries implicit evaluations that pre-structure thought. When an author describes a policy as 'intervention' versus 'support,' or a social formation as 'organic' versus 'constructed,' or a theoretical approach as 'rigorous' versus 'systematic,' they are not making explicitly defended evaluative claims but selecting terms whose connotations do silent argumentative work. This capability maps that connotation landscape, asking: What evaluative charge do key terms carry? Are those charges consistent with the author's stated analytical neutrality, or do they smuggle in partisan judgments? How do the author's connotations differ from standard disciplinary usage\u2014have they loaded previously neutral terms, or bleached previously loaded ones?\n\nConnotation mapping reveals the implicit rhetoric of conceptual choices. It identifies connotation-based pairs\u2014terms that differ primarily in affective charge rather than denotation ('freedom fighter' vs. 'insurgent,' 'welfare' vs. 'dependency,' 'market' vs. 'capitalism'). These pairs are diagnostic of ideological position often more reliably than explicit argument. The capability also tracks emotional and aesthetic associations that shape reader response: Does 'community' carry warm, solidaristic connotations while 'collective' carries cold, impersonal ones? These associations structure how arguments land, making certain conclusions feel natural or attractive before any explicit reasoning occurs. For downstream engines, the connotation landscape reveals the pre-argumentative framework\u2014the evaluative structure within which explicit reasoning operates.\n\nSophistication requires distinguishing between unavoidable connotation (all language carries some affective charge) and strategic loading. It also demands assessing whether the argument could survive connotation-stripping. Some arguments genuinely depend on explicit reasoning and would hold if all connotations were neutralized. Others derive their persuasive force primarily from connotative selection, and would collapse if terms were replaced with neutral equivalents. A sophisticated analysis performs this counterfactual test: if we replace 'organic solidarity' with 'type-A social cohesion' and 'mechanical solidarity' with 'type-B social cohesion,' does Durkheim's argument still work?
