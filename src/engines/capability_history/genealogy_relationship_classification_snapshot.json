Drawing on Harold Bloom's insight that influence is not uniform but takes specific forms\u2014the anxiety-laden struggle with precursors, the strategic misreading, the deliberate evasion\u2014it asks: what is the precise mode of connection between this prior work and the current argument? The classification is not merely descriptive but strategic, recognizing that a direct_precursor (whose ideas flow directly into the current work) demands close textual comparison for vocabulary transfers and argumentative inheritances, while a methodological_ancestor (whose tools rather than conclusions were adopted) requires scanning for structural parallels and analytical frameworks. A contradicted_position (against which the current work defines itself) leaves traces in rhetorical moves and oppositional framing, while a parallel_development (where similar ideas emerged independently) requires evidence of NON-connection\u2014the absence of citations, the different vocabularies, the divergent intellectual contexts.\n\nThis capability enables all subsequent genealogical work by determining how deeply and in what manner each prior work should be investigated. Without accurate classification, the genealogical pipeline wastes investigative resources: scanning a methodological_ancestor for vocabulary transfers yields nothing, while treating a direct_precursor as mere context misses the core of the relationship. The classification also determines which dimensions of relationship_evidence matter most and which influence_channels are likely to be active. It is the hinge between discovery (identifying that a relationship exists) and analysis (understanding what kind of relationship it is).\n\nWhat makes this non-trivial is that relationships are often hybrid or contested. An author may treat a work as indirect context while actually borrowing its methodology wholesale; a contradicted position may simultaneously function as a direct precursor for the very terms of debate. The capability must assign a primary type while remaining alert to secondary types, and must distinguish between the author's conscious relationship to a prior work and the actual intellectual connection.

How pervasive is the influence (does it affect one section or the entire work)? How direct is the evidence (explicit citation, implicit borrowing, or structural echo)? A strong relationship means the current work could not exist in its present form without the prior work; a moderate relationship means significant but not constitutive influence; a weak relationship means peripheral or highly localized influence.\n\nThis capability directly feeds strategic_relevance by determining attention allocation. A strong direct_precursor demands intensive Pass 2 scanning across multiple dimensions; a weak indirect_contextualizer may require only surface scanning for general framing. Without strength assessment, the pipeline treats all relationships as equal, wasting deep analysis on peripheral works while under-investigating formative ones. The capability also interacts with relationship_type: strength means different things for different types. A strong contradicted_position might appear throughout the work's rhetorical structure; a strong methodological_ancestor might be cited only once but structure every analytical move.\n\nThe non-trivial challenge is distinguishing genuine strength from ceremonial prominence. A work cited frequently might be weak (mere authority-lending); a work cited once might be strong (the single citation marking adoption of an entire framework). Strength also varies by aspect: a prior work might strongly influence methodology but weakly influence substantive claims.

Drawing on Cambridge School contextualism\u2014particularly Skinner's attention to how concepts carry their histories and Pocock's focus on vocabularies as carriers of tradition\u2014it asks not just whether influence exists but through what specific conduits it flows. A methodological_ancestor typically influences through methodology and possibly framing channels; a direct_precursor often through vocabulary and framing; a contradicted_position through framing (defining the problem space) and potentially authority (positioning against an established view).\n\nThis capability is crucial for strategic_relevance because it determines what Pass 2 scanners should look for. If the influence channel is primarily vocabulary, subsequent scanning should focus on concept_evolution and vocabulary_transfer dimensions. If methodology, then structural_inheritance and analytical_framework dimensions become priority. If audience, then reception_history and presupposition_structure dimensions matter most. The capability also reveals channel interactions: vocabulary transfers often carry methodological assumptions; audience preparation often involves authority transfer. Multiple channels can be active simultaneously, and their relative importance varies by relationship type.\n\nThe non-trivial dimension is that channels often operate below conscious awareness. An author may acknowledge vocabulary borrowing while remaining unaware of methodological inheritance; conversely, an author may credit methodological influence while the actual channel is problem framing.

Drawing on the bibliometric tradition's resource allocation logic and the broader intellectual history tradition's understanding that not all archival work yields equal insight, it performs strategic triage.

The capability must balance precision (scanning exactly where traces are likely) against flexibility (remaining open to unexpected findings).

When we trace the intellectual genealogy\nof an argument, we must first classify the NATURE of each relationship\nbefore we can determine how deeply to investigate it. A methodological\nancestor -- one whose analytical tools were adopted wholesale -- demands\na fundamentally different investigation than an indirect contextualizer\nthat merely set the broader intellectual climate.\n\nThis engine performs that triage. For each prior work, it asks: what is\nthe precise intellectual relationship to the current argument? Is this\na direct precursor whose ideas flow straight into the current work? A\ncontradicted position that the author argues against? A parallel\ndevelopment where similar ideas emerged independently? The classification\nis not merely taxonomic -- it is STRATEGIC. It determines the depth and\ndirection of all subsequent genealogical scanning.\n\nThe five relationship types form a spectrum of influence directness:\ndirect_precursor (the current argument could not exist without this work),\nindirect_contextualizer (sets the stage but does not directly feed the\nargument), methodological_ancestor (provides the HOW rather than the WHAT),\ncontradicted_position (the current work defines itself AGAINST this), and\nparallel_development (convergent evolution of ideas without causal link).\n\nThe classification also assesses CHANNELS of influence -- does the prior\nwork contribute vocabulary, methodology, audience preparation, authority,\nor framing? These channels determine where to look for traces in Pass 2.\nA methodological ancestor leaves traces in analytical structure; a\ncontradicted position leaves traces in argumentative rhetoric; an\nindirect contextualizer leaves traces in presupposed background knowledge.\n\nSpeed matters here. This engine operates on truncated excerpts and must\nclassify rapidly. It is a triage instrument, not a deep analysis tool.\nIts value lies in enabling the genealogical pipeline to allocate\ninvestigative resources efficiently -- spending deep attention where it\nwill yield the richest findings.\n",
