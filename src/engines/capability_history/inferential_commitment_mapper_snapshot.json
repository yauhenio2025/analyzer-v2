Implicit commitments are the downstream nodes in these inferential chains\u2014the claims that become part of your deontic score not by explicit undertaking but by material consequence. This capability performs inferential projection: given these explicit commitments, what else must be true? What positions become unavailable? What claims would the author need to deny to remain consistent? It identifies both tightly-bound implications (logical or conceptual necessities) and looser practical entailments that follow defeasibly but standardly.\n\nThis capability is crucial because it reveals the gap between what authors think they are arguing and what they are actually committed to. Authors may endorse a seemingly narrow claim without recognizing that it entails a much broader theoretical or political position. They may selectively emphasize certain implications while leaving embarrassing ones unstated. Surfacing implicit commitments makes the full inferential structure visible, allowing genealogical analysis to track not just what is said across a career but what is logically bound to what has been said. It also enables critical engagement: to challenge an argument effectively often means showing that its implicit commitments are unacceptable, even when its explicit commitments seem reasonable.\n\nThe sophistication lies in distinguishing strength of inference. Some implicit commitments are locked-in: deny them and you generate a contradiction. Others follow standardly but defeasibly: they are the normal inference absent special circumstances.

Dependency tracing constructs the full directed graph: for each commitment, what does it depend on, and what depends on it? It identifies dependency chains (sequences where A supports B supports C), assesses their length and strength, locates weak links (points where the inferential connection is questionable), and performs load-bearing analysis (what would collapse if a given foundational commitment were removed?).

Endorse a particular theory\nof human nature, and you have implicitly committed to a politics, an\nethics, and an epistemology. The inferential structure of ideas is\nthe hidden wiring beneath the surface of any argument: the logical\nconnections, dependencies, incompatibilities, and cascading\nimplications that determine what you are REALLY signing up for\nwhen you nod along.\n\nMost readers -- and many authors -- are unaware of this wiring.\nThey accept a conclusion without tracing what else it entails.\nThey endorse two positions without realizing they are incompatible.\nThey cite an authority without inheriting the full baggage of that\nauthority's commitments. This engine makes the invisible wiring\nvisible. It asks: what are the explicit commitments of this work?\nWhat implicit commitments follow from them? Where do commitments\nconflict? What logical dependencies create cascading chains where\none commitment forces another, which forces another? What are the\npackage deals -- bundles of ideas that can only be accepted or\nrejected as a whole?\n\nThe philosophical foundation is Brandom's inferentialism: the\nmeaning of a concept is constituted by its inferential role -- what\nit follows from, what follows from it, and what it is incompatible\nwith. But the output speaks in plain language, not philosophical\njargon. The method is Brandomian; the voice is accessible. The\ninsight is that commitment structures are not academic exercises\nbut practical maps: they tell you what you can and cannot say next,\nwhat positions are available to you, and what contradictions you\nmust navigate.\n\nAs the THIRD and final engine in the target profiling chain, this\nengine synthesizes the outputs of both prior engines into a\ncommitment landscape. The vocabulary and frameworks extracted by\nconceptual_framework_extraction become the objects of commitment\nanalysis. The semantic relationships mapped by concept_semantic_\nconstellation reveal which commitments are semantically entangled.\nThe result is the deepest layer of the target profile: not just\nwhat the author says (vocabulary), not just how concepts relate\n(semantic fields), but what logical structure binds it all together\nand what you are really agreeing to when you accept it.\n\nFor genealogical analysis, the commitment structure is the\nskeleton. Vocabulary changes, metaphors evolve, framing shifts --\nbut the deep inferential commitments often persist across an\nauthor's career, sometimes beneath the author's own awareness.\nTracking commitment persistence and mutation across works is\nthe most reliable method for detecting genuine intellectual\ncontinuity vs. surface-level change.\n",
