  "researcher_question": "What does this concept make possible?",
  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in Deleuzian analysis, examining concepts as productive forces.\n\nFor this article, perform a CONCEPTUAL AFFORDANCE ANALYSIS:\n\n## 1. CONCEPT IDENTIFICATION\nFor each significant concept:\n- **Term**: The concept name/phrase\n- **Definition**: How it's used\n- **Pragmatic function**: What work is it doing?\n\n## 2. ENABLED POSSIBILITIES\nFor each concept, identify what it MAKES POSSIBLE:\n- **Cognitive possibilities**: What new thoughts/questions does it enable?\n- **Practical possibilities**: What actions does it enable?\n- **Institutional possibilities**: What organizations/structures does it enable?\n- **Social possibilities**: What relationships/identities does it enable?\n- **Political possibilities**: What movements/positions does it enable?\n\nNote: Are these actualized or merely virtual (possible but not yet real)?\n\n## 3. BLOCKED PATHS\nFor each concept, identify what it FORECLOSES:\n- **What becomes unthinkable?** What questions can't be asked?\n- **What becomes undoable?** What actions are ruled out?\n- **What becomes invisible?** What can't be seen through this lens?\n- **What alternatives are obscured?** What other ways of thinking are blocked?\n\n## 4. ASSEMBLAGE ANALYSIS\nIdentify assemblages the concept participates in:\n- **What practices** does it connect with?\n- **What institutions** use it?\n- **What technologies** rely on it?\n- **What other concepts** does it combine with?\n- **What emerges** from these combinations?\n\n## 5. LINES OF FLIGHT\nIdentify escape possibilities:\n- **What constraints** might this concept help escape?\n- **What new territories** might it open?\n- **What resistances** would this encounter?\n- **What re-capture risks** exist?\n\n## 6. TERRITORIALIZATION EFFECTS\nHow does this concept stabilize or destabilize:\n- **What gets ordered/categorized?**\n- **What gets coded/decoded?**\n- **What regimes does it support or undermine?**\n\n\nThink pragmatically - what does this concept DO, not just what does it MEAN?\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing conceptual affordance analyses from multiple articles.\n\nYour task:\n\n## 1. CONSOLIDATE CONCEPT INVENTORIES\n- Merge same concepts across articles\n- Collect all affordance information\n- Calculate affordance richness scores\n\n## 2. MAP ENABLED POSSIBILITIES\n- Aggregate possibilities enabled by each concept\n- Categorize by type (cognitive, practical, institutional, etc.)\n- Note what's actualized vs. merely virtual\n- Identify conditions for actualization\n\n## 3. MAP BLOCKED PATHS\n- Aggregate what each concept forecloses\n- Identify patterns in blockages\n- Note workarounds and alternative concepts\n- Find concepts that open what others close\n\n## 4. BUILD ASSEMBLAGE MAPS\n- Identify recurring assemblages across articles\n- Map their components (concepts, practices, institutions, technologies)\n- Identify emergent properties\n- Assess assemblage stability\n\n## 5. TRACE LINES OF FLIGHT\n- Identify escape routes opened by concepts\n- Map where they lead\n- Identify resistances and re-capture risks\n- Assess viability of different escape routes\n\n## 6. ANALYZE TERRITORIALIZATION DYNAMICS\n- Identify what concepts stabilize\n- Identify what they destabilize\n- Map coding/overcoding effects\n- Assess overall territorial function\n\n## 7. IDENTIFY CONCEPTUAL MACHINES\n- Find concept combinations that produce consistent effects\n- Map their operational logic\n- Identify failure conditions\n\n\nCreate a map that reveals the productive power of concepts in this discourse.\n",
