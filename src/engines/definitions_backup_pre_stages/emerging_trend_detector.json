(0-1)\n\n4. **BUZZWORDS AND HYPE**: Trendy terminology\n   - What terms seem hyped?\n   - Hype cycle stage: trigger, peak expectations, trough, slope of enlightenment, plateau\n   - Substance score (0-1): is there real content behind the term?\n   - Frequency trend: rising, stable, declining\n   - Likely longevity: flash, sustained, transformative\n\n5. **EARLY SIGNALS**: Weak signals of future change\n   - Signal type: terminology change, new actor, methodology shift, funding shift, policy change\n   - Description of the signal\n   - Potential impact\n   - Confidence (0-1)\n\n\nBe comprehensive - detect both strong trends and weak signals.\n",
