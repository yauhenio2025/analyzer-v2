  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are detecting REIFICATION - where abstractions are treated as concrete entities.\n\n## TYPES OF REIFICATION\n\n### CONCEPT REIFICATION\nAbstract concepts treated as things that act:\n- \"Society demands...\" (society isn't an agent)\n- \"The market decided...\" (markets don't decide)\n- \"History shows...\" (history doesn't show, people interpret)\n\n### STATISTICAL REIFICATION\nStatistical constructs treated as real entities:\n- \"The average person\" (no such person exists)\n- GDP as a measure of wellbeing (it's a specific calculation)\n- IQ as intelligence (it's a test score)\n\n### THEORETICAL REIFICATION\nTheoretical entities treated as concrete:\n- Treating \"human capital\" as actual capital\n- Treating \"social forces\" as physical forces\n- Treating \"market equilibrium\" as a real state\n\n### METAPHOR LITERALIZATION\nMetaphors taken as literal descriptions:\n- \"Information flows\" (treated as if actually flowing)\n- \"Mind as computer\" (then assuming computational properties)\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY ABSTRACTIONS USED\nWhat abstract concepts, categories, or constructs are used?\n- Categories (society, market, culture)\n- Statistical constructs (average, median, index)\n- Theoretical entities (capital, utility, equilibrium)\n- Metaphors (flow, force, network)\n\n### STEP 2: DETECT REIFICATION\nWhere are these abstractions treated as concrete?\n- Given causal agency?\n- Treated as acting or deciding?\n- Given properties they can't have?\n\n### STEP 3: IDENTIFY CATEGORY ERRORS\nWhere are levels of abstraction confused?\n- Aggregate treated as individual?\n- Statistical summary treated as real entity?\n- Theoretical construct treated as observable?\n\n### STEP 4: FLAG LITERALIZED METAPHORS\nWhere are metaphors taken literally?\n- What's the original metaphor?\n- How is it literalized?\n- What problems does this cause?\n\n### STEP 5: SUGGEST CORRECTIONS\nHow should these be properly understood?\n- What is the abstraction actually?\n- How should claims be reformulated?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about the reification. \"The text reifies society\" is not useful.\n\"The claim that 'society rejected this idea' treats society as a unified\nagent capable of rejection, when actually [specific groups/processes]...\" is useful.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing reification analyses across multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. AGGREGATE REIFICATIONS\n- What concepts are commonly reified?\n- What patterns appear?\n\n### 2. ASSESS SEVERITY\n- Which reifications are most problematic?\n- What errors do they lead to?\n\n### 3. SUGGEST CORRECTIONS\n- How should key concepts be understood?\n- What reformulations are needed?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive map of reifications and their corrections.\n",
