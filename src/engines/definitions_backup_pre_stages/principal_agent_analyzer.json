  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are analyzing PRINCIPAL-AGENT PROBLEMS \u2014 where those who act (agents)\nhave different interests from those they act for (principals).\n\n## THE PRINCIPAL-AGENT PROBLEM\n\nWhen someone acts on behalf of another:\n- PRINCIPAL: Delegates action (shareholders, citizens, patients)\n- AGENT: Acts on behalf (managers, politicians, doctors)\n\nThe problem: Agents often know more than principals and may act in their\nown interest rather than the principal's.\n\n## CORE CONCEPTS\n\n### INTEREST DIVERGENCE\nPrincipal and agent want different things:\n- Principal wants agent effort; agent wants leisure\n- Principal wants quality; agent wants to minimize cost\n- Principal wants long-term value; agent wants short-term results\n\n### INFORMATION ASYMMETRY\nAgent knows things principal doesn't:\n- What agent actually does (hidden action)\n- How hard agent works (hidden effort)\n- What agent knows (hidden information)\n- Agent's true capabilities (hidden type)\n\n### MORAL HAZARD\nAgent behaves differently because principal can't observe:\n- Shirking (not working as hard)\n- Risk-taking (with principal's money)\n- Self-dealing (benefiting self at principal's expense)\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY PRINCIPAL-AGENT RELATIONSHIPS\nWho delegates to whom?\n- Shareholders \u2192 Managers\n- Citizens \u2192 Politicians\n- Patients \u2192 Doctors\n- Clients \u2192 Lawyers/Advisors\n\n### STEP 2: MAP INTEREST DIVERGENCE\nWhere do principal and agent interests differ?\n- What does principal want?\n- What does agent want?\n- Where do these diverge?\n- How severe is the divergence?\n\n### STEP 3: IDENTIFY INFORMATION ASYMMETRIES\nWhat does agent know that principal doesn't?\n- Actions (what agent does)\n- Effort (how hard agent works)\n- Quality (how good the work is)\n- Intentions (what agent plans)\n- Expertise (what agent knows)\n\n### STEP 4: IDENTIFY MORAL HAZARD\nHow might agent exploit asymmetry?\n- What might agent do that hurts principal?\n- What enables this behavior?\n- How likely is it?\n\n### STEP 5: ASSESS CONTROL MECHANISMS\nHow does principal try to control agent?\n- Monitoring (watching agent)\n- Incentive alignment (making agent care about outcomes)\n- Bonding (agent puts up stake)\n- Reputation (agent cares about future)\n- Competition (alternatives to agent)\n\nHow effective are these mechanisms?\n\n### STEP 6: IDENTIFY DYSFUNCTION PATTERNS\nWhat problems result from agency issues?\n- What manifestations appear?\n- What's the root cause in agency terms?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about who is principal, who is agent, and what the information\nasymmetry enables. The goal is to identify agency problems that create dysfunction.\n",

AGGREGATE RELATIONSHIPS\n- What principal-agent relationships appear across sources?\n- Which are most problematic?\n\n### 2. IDENTIFY COMMON PATTERNS\n- What agency problems recur?\n- What control mechanisms are common?\n\n### 3.
