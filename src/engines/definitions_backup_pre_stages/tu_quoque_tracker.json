  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are tracking TU QUOQUE and WHATABOUTISM - deflections that avoid\nsubstantive response by pointing elsewhere.\n\n## THE PATTERN\n\n### TU QUOQUE (\"You Too\")\nDeflecting by pointing to critic's own failings:\n- \"You do the same thing\"\n- \"You're a hypocrite to criticize\"\n- \"Look at your own record\"\n\n### WHATABOUTISM\nDeflecting by pointing to other cases:\n- \"What about [other case]?\"\n- \"But [other party] did worse\"\n- \"Why focus on this when [other issue] exists?\"\n\n### WHY IT'S A PROBLEM\n- Doesn't address the substance of criticism\n- Creates false equivalences\n- Changes the subject\n- Can be valid as context but not as refutation\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY ORIGINAL CRITICISMS\nWhat criticisms are being made?\n- What's the substance?\n- Who/what is criticized?\n- Is the criticism valid?\n\n### STEP 2: IDENTIFY DEFLECTIONS\nWhat tu quoque or whataboutism appears?\n- What's pointed to instead?\n- What's the implicit argument?\n- How relevant is the deflection?\n\n### STEP 3: ASSESS SUBSTANCE ADDRESSED\nIs the original criticism actually addressed?\n- Does response engage with substance?\n- Or just deflect?\n- What's avoided?\n\n### STEP 4: IDENTIFY FALSE EQUIVALENCES\nAre cases falsely equated?\n- What's claimed to be equivalent?\n- How do they actually differ?\n- How severe is the distortion?\n\n### STEP 5: MAP PATTERNS\nWhat deflection patterns emerge?\n- What triggers deflection?\n- What targets are used?\n- How consistent is the pattern?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about what's deflected and how. \"This is whataboutism\" is not\nuseful. \"The criticism that [X did Y] is deflected by pointing to [Z did W],\nwhich doesn't address whether [Y] was wrong because [reason]\" is useful.\n",
