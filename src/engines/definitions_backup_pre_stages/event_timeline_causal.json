(Concise description)\n2. **WHEN**: Date or time period\n   - Precision: exact date, month, year, approximate, or relative (e.g., \"before X\")\n3. **TYPE**: Policy, market, political, technological, social, legal, crisis\n4. **WHO**: Actors involved\n5. **WHERE**: Location (if mentioned)\n6. **SIGNIFICANCE**: High, medium, low\n\n## CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS\nFor each causal claim:\n1. **CAUSE \u2192 EFFECT**: Which event caused which?\n2. **RELATIONSHIP TYPE**:\n   - Direct cause: A directly caused B\n   - Enabling condition: A made B possible\n   - Trigger: A was the proximate cause of B\n   - Contributing factor: A was one of several causes\n\n3. **MECHANISM**: How did causation work?\n4. **STRENGTH**: How strong is the causal link? (0-1)\n5. **TIME LAG**: How long between cause and effect?\n6. **EXPLICIT?**: Is this causation claimed or inferred?\n\n## CAUSAL CHAINS\nIdentify longer causal sequences:\n- A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D\n- Note if chains branch, converge, or loop\n\n## PERIODS\nIdentify named eras or phases:\n- What characterizes each period?\n- What events mark transitions?\n\n\nExtract every event and causal claim you can identify.\n",

  "concretization_prompt": "\nTransform the timeline to use concrete, recognizable labels:\n\n1. Convert event_ids to descriptive names:\n   - \"E1\" \u2192 \"Lehman Brothers Collapse (Sept 2008)\"\n   - \"E2\" \u2192 \"GDPR Enforcement Begins (May 2018)\"\n\n2. Name causal chains:\n   - \"Chain 1\" \u2192 \"The 2008 Regulatory Cascade\"\n   - \"Chain 2\" \u2192 \"Tech Antitrust Momentum\"\n\n3. Label periods clearly:\n   - \"Period 1\" \u2192 \"The Deregulation Era (1980-2007)\"\n   - \"Period 2\" \u2192 \"Post-Crisis Reform Period\"\n\n4. Make dates concrete:\n   - Convert relative dates to absolute where possible\n   - Note uncertainty explicitly\n\nPreserve all temporal ordering and causal relationships.\nMake the chronology immediately navigable.\n",
