Every transaction has costs beyond the price:\n- Finding trading partners\n- Negotiating terms\n- Writing contracts\n- Monitoring compliance\n- Enforcing agreements\n\nWhen these costs are high, markets fail and hierarchies emerge.\n\n\"The main reason why it is profitable to establish a firm would seem to be\nthat there is a cost to using the price mechanism.\" \u2014 Ronald Coase\n\n## TRANSACTION COST COMPONENTS\n\n### SEARCH COSTS\nFinding trading partners and information:\n- Who can provide what I need?\n- What's the quality?\n- What's the fair price?\n\n### BARGAINING COSTS\nNegotiating the deal:\n- What are the terms?\n- How long does negotiation take?\n- Risk of hold-up?\n\n### CONTRACTING COSTS\nWriting the agreement:\n- Can we specify everything?\n- What about unforeseen contingencies?\n- Legal fees and complexity?\n\n### MONITORING COSTS\nEnsuring compliance:\n- Can we observe what they're doing?\n- How do we check quality?\n- Moral hazard problems?\n\n### ENFORCEMENT COSTS\nDealing with breaches:\n- Can we prove breach?\n- Will courts enforce?\n- What sanctions are available?\n\n## KEY FACTORS\n\n### ASSET SPECIFICITY\nHow specific are investments to this relationship?\n- Site specificity (location-bound)\n- Physical asset specificity (specialized equipment)\n- Human asset specificity (specialized skills)\n- Dedicated assets (investment for this customer)\n\nHigh specificity \u2192 high lock-in \u2192 high hold-up risk \u2192 favor hierarchy\n\n### UNCERTAINTY\nHow uncertain is the environment?\n- Can we anticipate all contingencies?\n- How stable are conditions?\n\nHigh uncertainty \u2192 incomplete contracts \u2192 favor hierarchy\n\n### FREQUENCY\nHow often do transactions occur?\n- One-time vs. repeated\n- Duration of relationship\n\nHigh frequency \u2192 justify specialized governance\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE TRANSACTION\nWhat exchange is being analyzed?\n- Who are the parties?\n- What's being exchanged?\n- What governance structure exists?\n\n### STEP 2: ASSESS SEARCH COSTS\nHow costly is finding partners and information?\n- Information asymmetry?\n- Quality verification difficulty?\n\n### STEP 3: ASSESS BARGAINING COSTS\nHow costly is negotiation?\n- Complexity?\n- Hold-up risk?\n- Bargaining power distribution?\n\n### STEP 4: ASSESS CONTRACTING COSTS\nHow costly is writing contracts?\n- Completeness possible?\n- Uncertainty level?\n- Specification difficulty?\n\n### STEP 5: ASSESS MONITORING COSTS\nHow costly is ensuring compliance?\n- Observability?\n- Moral hazard?\n- Monitoring mechanisms?\n\n### STEP 6: ASSESS ENFORCEMENT COSTS\nHow costly is dealing with breaches?\n- Legal system quality?\n- Dispute resolution?\n- Sanction mechanisms?\n\n### STEP 7: ANALYZE ASSET SPECIFICITY\nHow specific are investments?\n- Site, physical, human, dedicated?\n- Lock-in implications?\n\n### STEP 8: ANALYZE GOVERNANCE FIT\nIs governance structure appropriate?\n- Given transaction costs and specificity?\n- Would alternatives be better?\n\n### STEP 9: MAKE-OR-BUY ANALYSIS\nIf applicable:\n- Transaction costs of market vs. hierarchy?\n- Production costs of market vs. hierarchy?\n- Optimal governance?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about cost components.\nIdentify the highest-cost elements.\nConnect to governance implications.\n",
