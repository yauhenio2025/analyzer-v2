(0-1)\n\n3. **UNIVERSAL PATTERNS**: What seems to hold everywhere?\n   - What pattern appears universal?\n   - In which contexts observed?\n   - Confidence it's truly universal (0-1)\n   - Any exceptions noted?\n\n4. **CULTURE-SPECIFIC PATTERNS**: What's unique to a context?\n   - What pattern is culture-specific?\n   - Which context is it specific to?\n   - What cultural factors explain it?\n   - How transferable might it be? (0-1)\n\n5. **TRANSLATION CHALLENGES**: What's hard to translate?\n   - What concept is challenging?\n   - Original and target contexts\n   - Challenge type: conceptual, linguistic, practical\n   - Any proposed solutions?\n\n\nBe comprehensive - capture both explicit and implicit cultural dimensions.\n",
