  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are implementing SCENARIO PLANNING methodology \u2014 mapping the space of\nplausible futures to prepare for uncertainty rather than pretend to predict.\n\n## THE SCENARIO PLANNING PHILOSOPHY\n\nWe cannot predict the future. But we CAN:\n1. Identify the KEY DRIVERS that will shape it\n2. Acknowledge what we DON'T KNOW (uncertainties)\n3. Construct MULTIPLE PLAUSIBLE FUTURES\n4. Think through the PATHWAY to each\n5. Identify what's ROBUST across futures\n\nGoal: Not to predict, but to prepare.\n\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: DEFINE THE FOCAL QUESTION\n\nWhat strategic question are we trying to illuminate?\n- What decision does this inform?\n- What time horizon matters?\n- What's in scope and out of scope?\n\n### STEP 2: IDENTIFY KEY DRIVERS\n\nWhat forces/factors will most shape the future in this domain?\n\n**Driver types:**\n- Structural: Long-term, slow-moving forces\n- Cyclical: Recurring patterns\n- Technological: Tech development trajectories\n- Social: Demographic, cultural, behavioral trends\n- Political: Governance, policy, power dynamics\n- Economic: Markets, resources, trade\n- Environmental: Climate, resources, physical constraints\n- Wild cards: Low probability but high impact surprises\n\nFor each driver:\n- Where is it now? (current state)\n- Where could it go? (range of outcomes)\n- How uncertain is its trajectory?\n- How much impact would changes have?\n\n### STEP 3: IDENTIFY CRITICAL UNCERTAINTIES\n\nWhich drivers have high uncertainty AND high impact?\nThese are the axes for scenario construction.\n\n### STEP 4: CONSTRUCT SCENARIOS\n\nSelect the 2 most critical uncertainties as axes.\nThis creates a 2x2 matrix with 4 quadrants.\n\nFor each quadrant, construct a scenario:\n- Give it an evocative NAME\n- Write a NARRATIVE\n- Specify DRIVER CONFIGURATION\n- Check INTERNAL CONSISTENCY\n- Assess PROBABILITY\n\n### STEP 5: DEVELOP SCENARIO DETAILS\n\nFor each scenario:\n- KEY FEATURES: What defines this world?\n- WINNERS/LOSERS: Who benefits, who suffers?\n- IMPLICATIONS: What does this mean?\n- EARLY INDICATORS: What signs would tell us this is emerging?\n\n### STEP 6: MAP PATHWAYS\n\nHow do we get from here to each scenario?\n- What's the NARRATIVE?\n- What are KEY EVENTS along the way?\n- Where are BRANCH POINTS?\n- What would ACCELERATE or DECELERATE this path?\n\n### STEP 7: CROSS-SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\nWhat's consistent across scenarios?\n- ROBUST FINDINGS: True in multiple scenarios\n- CONTINGENT FINDINGS: Depends on which scenario\n\n### STEP 8: STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS\n\nWhat should decision-makers do?\n- ROBUST STRATEGIES: Work across multiple scenarios\n- HEDGING OPTIONS: Protect against specific scenarios\n- MONITORING PRIORITIES: What to watch\n- DECISION TRIGGERS: When to act\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nScenarios should be PLAUSIBLE, DISTINCT, CHALLENGING, and DECISION-RELEVANT.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing scenario analyses from multiple sources to create a\ncomprehensive possibility space map.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. CONSOLIDATE DRIVERS\n- Merge equivalent drivers from different sources\n- Note where sources agree/disagree on driver importance\n- Identify drivers only one source mentions\n\n### 2. TRIANGULATE UNCERTAINTIES\n- Which uncertainties appear across sources?\n- Do sources agree on uncertainty levels?\n\n### 3. INTEGRATE SCENARIOS\n- Do different sources imagine similar futures?\n- Are there complementary scenarios?\n- Are there contradictory scenarios?\n\n### 4. COMBINE PATHWAY ANALYSIS\n- Do sources identify similar pathways?\n- Are there pathway branches one source sees but another misses?\n\n### 5. SYNTHESIZE IMPLICATIONS\n- What robust findings emerge across sources?\n- What's contingent?\n- What strategic implications appear consistently?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate a comprehensive scenario framework that:\n1. Maps the full possibility space\n2. Builds on multiple source perspectives\n3. Identifies robust vs. contingent insights\n4. Provides actionable strategic guidance\n",
