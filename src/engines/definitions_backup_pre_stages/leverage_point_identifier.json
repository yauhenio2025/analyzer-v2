  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are identifying LEVERAGE POINTS \u2014 places in systems where small\ninterventions can produce large effects.\n\n## THE LEVERAGE POINT HIERARCHY (from lowest to highest leverage)\n\n### 12. PARAMETERS (Lowest leverage)\nConstants and numbers: taxes, prices, standards.\nEasy to change but rarely change system behavior much.\n\n### 11. BUFFER SIZES\nStabilizing stocks relative to flows.\n\n### 10. STOCK-AND-FLOW STRUCTURES\nPhysical system structure (pipes, roads, etc.).\n\n### 9. DELAYS\nLength of time in feedback loops.\n\n### 8. BALANCING FEEDBACK LOOPS\nNegative feedbacks that stabilize.\n\n### 7. REINFORCING FEEDBACK LOOPS\nPositive feedbacks that amplify.\n\n### 6. INFORMATION FLOWS\nWho has access to what information.\n\n### 5. RULES OF THE SYSTEM\nIncentives, constraints, permissions.\n\n### 4. SELF-ORGANIZATION\nAbility to create new structures.\n\n### 3. GOALS OF THE SYSTEM\nWhat the system is trying to achieve.\n\n### 2. PARADIGMS\nThe worldview from which goals and rules emerge.\n\n### 1. TRANSCENDING PARADIGMS (Highest leverage)\nAbility to change paradigms.\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM\nWhat are we trying to change?\n- What problems exist?\n- What's been tried?\n- Why hasn't it worked?\n\n### STEP 2: IDENTIFY LEVERAGE POINTS\nLook for places where small changes could have large effects:\n- Where are the feedback loops? Can they be strengthened/weakened?\n- What information is hidden that could change behavior if visible?\n- What rules are creating problems? Could they be changed?\n- What goals are driving behavior? Are they the right goals?\n- What paradigm is shaping everything?\n\nFor each leverage point:\n- What type is it (parameter, feedback, structure, goal, paradigm)?\n- Why is this high/low leverage?\n- What intervention is possible?\n- What effect would it have?\n\n### STEP 3: ANALYZE FAILED INTERVENTIONS\nWhat has been tried and failed?\n- Why did it fail?\n- How did the system resist?\n- What does this teach about leverage?\n\n### STEP 4: IDENTIFY COUNTERINTUITIVE DYNAMICS\nWhere does intuition fail?\n- What obvious interventions don't work?\n- What non-obvious interventions would work?\n- Why the mismatch?\n\n### STEP 5: MAP SYSTEM RESISTANCE\nHow does the system resist change?\n- Feedback correction (system compensates)\n- Goal displacement (system pursues something else)\n- Power preservation (those benefiting from status quo resist)\n\n### STEP 6: RANK AND RECOMMEND\nPrioritize leverage points by:\n- Potential impact\n- Feasibility\n- Resistance expected\n\nRecommend specific interventions with expected effects.\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about mechanisms. \"Change the incentives\" is too vague.\n\"Tie manager bonuses to long-term outcomes rather than quarterly results\"\nis actionable.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing leverage point analyses from multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. CONSOLIDATE LEVERAGE POINTS\n- Merge equivalent leverage points from different sources\n- Compare rankings across sources\n- Identify leverage points only one source sees\n\n### 2. VALIDATE THROUGH FAILURE ANALYSIS\n- Do failed interventions confirm leverage point analysis?\n- What do failures teach about where real leverage lies?\n\n### 3. SYNTHESIZE COUNTERINTUITIVE INSIGHTS\n- Where do multiple sources identify counterintuitive dynamics?\n- What patterns emerge?\n\n### 4. PRIORITIZE INTERVENTIONS\n- What leverage points appear most actionable across sources?\n- Where is there disagreement on leverage?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate prioritized intervention recommendations based on multi-source\nleverage analysis.\n",
