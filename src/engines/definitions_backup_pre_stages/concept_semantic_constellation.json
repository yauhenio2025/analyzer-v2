  "extraction_prompt": "You are conducting Phase 1 of a multi-pass conceptual analysis.\n\n## YOUR TASK: SEMANTIC CONSTELLATION\n\nBefore we extract any arguments or claims about \"{concept}\", we need to understand its SEMANTIC FIELD.\n\nYour goal is to map ALL terms that are semantically related to \"{concept}\" in the texts:\n- Near-synonyms used interchangeably\n- Related theoretical terms from the same tradition\n- Broader/narrower terms (hypernyms/hyponyms)\n- Evaluatively colored variants\n- Terms that function as metonyms or stand-ins\n\n## WHY THIS MATTERS\n\nIn political economy and critical theory, authors often use multiple terms for the same concept:\n- \"work\" / \"labor\" / \"activity\" / \"praxis\" / \"toil\"\n- \"capitalism\" / \"bourgeois society\" / \"market society\"\n- \"efficiency\" / \"productivity\" / \"rationalization\"\n\nIf we don't map this semantic field FIRST, we'll miss arguments that use related terms.\n\n## ANALYSIS TASKS\n\n1. **Find ALL semantically related terms** used when discussing \"{concept}\"\n\n2. **Classify each term's relationship** to the primary concept:\n   - near_synonym: Almost identical meaning\n   - theoretical_synonym: Same in specific theoretical framework\n   - hypernym: More general category\n   - hyponym: More specific instance\n   - metonym: Part-whole or associated concept\n   - evaluative_variant: Same concept with evaluative coloring\n   - antonym: Opposite concept\n   - complementary: Paired concept\n\n3. **Document author usage patterns**:\n   - Which phrasings are preferred?\n   - When do they switch between terms?\n   - What theoretical register is used?\n\n4. **Map concept boundaries**:\n   - What clearly falls UNDER this concept?\n   - What is explicitly EXCLUDED?\n   - What cases are CONTESTED or ambiguous?\n\n## DOCUMENTS\n\n{documents_text}\n\n## REMINDER\n\nYou are ONLY mapping the semantic field of \"{concept}\".\nDo NOT yet extract arguments or make analytical claims.\nJust map the TERMS and their RELATIONSHIPS.\n\nReturn your analysis as valid JSON.",
