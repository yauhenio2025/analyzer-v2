  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are an expert data analyst extracting and evaluating statistical evidence.\n\nFor this article, extract ALL statistical and quantitative information:\n\n1. **STATISTICS**: Every number, percentage, ratio mentioned\n   - Exact value (e.g., \"47%\", \"$3.2 trillion\", \"3:1 ratio\")\n   - What the statistic measures (subject)\n   - Context in which it appears\n\n2. **SOURCE INFORMATION**: Where does this data come from?\n   - Source name (organization, study, report)\n   - Source type: government, academic, industry, NGO, media\n   - Year of data\n   - Is methodology mentioned?\n\n3. **QUALITY ASSESSMENT**: Rate each statistic's reliability\n   - Source credibility (0-1)\n   - Methodology transparency (0-1)\n   - Sample size adequacy (if mentioned)\n   - Recency: current, dated, outdated\n\n4. **CLAIM STRENGTH**: How strong is the statistical claim?\n   - STRONG: Credible source, clear methodology, recent\n   - MODERATE: Some quality indicators present\n   - WEAK: Poor sourcing or methodology\n   - UNVERIFIABLE: Cannot assess quality\n\n5. **DATA PATTERNS**: Identify trends, comparisons, correlations\n   - What story do the numbers tell?\n\n\nBe comprehensive - capture every quantitative claim and assess its quality.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing statistical evidence from multiple articles.\n\nYour task:\n1. **CATALOG ALL STATISTICS**: Create comprehensive inventory\n   - Group by topic/subject\n   - Note value types\n   - Preserve source information\n\n2. **IDENTIFY CONFLICTS**: Find contradictory statistics\n   - Same topic, different numbers\n   - Note magnitude of discrepancy\n   - Suggest possible explanations (different years, methodologies, definitions)\n\n3. **ASSESS OVERALL DATA QUALITY**:\n   - Average source credibility across corpus\n   - How much methodology is documented?\n   - How recent is the data overall?\n\n4. **FIND DATA GAPS**: What's missing?\n   - Topics where statistics are needed but absent\n   - Rate importance of each gap\n   - Note what data would be helpful\n\n5. **MAP DATA PATTERNS**:\n   - What trends emerge across statistics?\n   - What comparisons are most meaningful?\n\n\nCreate a comprehensive statistical evidence catalog for research use.\n",

Format statistics clearly:\n   - \"S1\" \u2192 \"47% of workers report job insecurity (Gallup, 2024)\"\n\n2. Name contested statistics by topic:\n   - \"Conflict1\" \u2192 \"Disputed: AI Job Displacement Rates\"\n\n3. Describe data gaps specifically:\n   - \"Gap1\" \u2192 \"Missing: Longitudinal data on reskilling outcomes\"\n\n4. Label patterns descriptively:\n   - \"Pattern1\" \u2192 \"Upward trend in automation investment 2020-2024\"\n\nPreserve all quality assessments and metrics.\nMake the catalog immediately useful for evidence-based writing.\n",
