  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are an expert information extractor identifying named entities in text.\n\nFor this article, extract ALL named entities:\n\n## 1. PEOPLE\nFor each person mentioned:\n- **NAME**: Full name\n- **TITLE/ROLE**: Their position or function\n- **AFFILIATION**: Organization they belong to\n- **AUTHORITY LEVEL**: Executive, expert, official, spokesperson, other\n- **CONTEXT**: Why are they mentioned?\n- **SIGNIFICANCE**: How important to the story (high/medium/low)\n\n## 2.

LOCATIONS\nFor each geographic location mentioned:\n- **NAME**: Place name\n- **TYPE**: Country, state/province, city, region, other\n- **CONTEXT**: Why is this location relevant?\n- **SIGNIFICANCE**: Geographic importance to story\n\n## 4. PRODUCTS & TECHNOLOGIES\nFor each product or technology mentioned:\n- **NAME**: Product/technology name\n- **TYPE**: Software, hardware, platform, service, drug, etc.\n- **OWNER/CREATOR**: Company or entity behind it\n- **CONTEXT**: Why is it discussed?\n- **SIGNIFICANCE**: How central to the story\n\n## 5.

RELATIONSHIPS\nIdentify explicit relationships between entities:\n- Who employs whom\n- Who owns what\n- Who regulates whom\n- Who competes with whom\n- Who partners with whom\n\n\nBe comprehensive - capture every named entity that appears.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing entity data from multiple articles into a comprehensive catalog.\n\nYour task:\n1. **CONSOLIDATE ENTITIES**: Merge references to the same entity\n   - Match by name variations (IBM, International Business Machines)\n   - Aggregate mention counts\n   - Combine context from different articles\n\n2. **CLASSIFY AND SUBTYPE**: Assign precise types\n   - Main type (person, organization, place, product, event)\n   - Subtype for precision (CEO, tech company, regulatory agency, city, etc.)\n\n3. **ASSESS SIGNIFICANCE**:\n   - HIGH: Central to the discourse, mentioned repeatedly\n   - MEDIUM: Important supporting entity\n   - LOW: Peripheral mention\n\n4. **MAP RELATIONSHIPS**:\n   - Employment (person \u2192 organization)\n   - Ownership (organization \u2192 product/subsidiary)\n   - Regulation (agency \u2192 industry/company)\n   - Competition (organization \u2194 organization)\n   - Partnership (organization \u2194 organization)\n   - Location (entity \u2192 place)\n\n5. **IDENTIFY CLUSTERS**:\n   - Industry clusters (tech companies, pharma, etc.)\n   - Regional clusters (Silicon Valley players, EU institutions)\n   - Alliance clusters (partners, consortiums)\n\n6. **CALCULATE METRICS**:\n   - Total entities by type\n   - Most frequently mentioned\n   - Most connected (relationship count)\n\n\nCreate a comprehensive entity catalog for research use.\n",
  "concretization_prompt": "\nTransform the entity catalog to be immediately usable:\n\n1. Replace generic IDs with full identities:\n   - \"E1\" \u2192 \"Satya Nadella (CEO, Microsoft)\"\n   - \"O1\" \u2192 \"European Commission (EU regulatory body)\"\n\n2. Clarify relationship types:\n   - Add context to each relationship\n   - Note if relationship is inferred vs. explicit\n\n3. Name clusters descriptively:\n   - \"Cluster1\" \u2192 \"Big Tech AI Leaders\"\n\n4. Highlight most significant entities:\n   - Mark entities that are central to understanding the corpus\n\nPreserve all metrics and relationship mappings.\nMake the catalog immediately useful for analysis.\n",
