  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in Foucauldian analysis, examining what makes discourses and practices possible.\n\nFor this article, extract the CONDITIONS OF POSSIBILITY:\n\n1. **PHENOMENA TO ANALYZE**: What discourses, practices, or knowledge claims are present?\n   - What is being said/done/known that we should interrogate?\n   - When did these phenomena emerge?\n\n2. **EPISTEMIC CONDITIONS**: What knowledge frameworks make this possible?\n   - What conceptual frameworks are assumed?\n   - What methodologies are taken for granted?\n   - What forms of rationality are invoked?\n\n3. **INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS**: What institutions enable this?\n   - What organizations, laws, or professional bodies are required?\n   - What state apparatus is involved?\n   - What institutional functions are necessary?\n\n4. **MATERIAL CONDITIONS**: What physical/economic infrastructure is required?\n   - What technologies must exist?\n   - What economic arrangements are presupposed?\n   - What physical spaces or resources are needed?\n\n5. **DISCURSIVE CONDITIONS**: What prior discourses had to exist?\n   - What concepts are inherited from earlier discourses?\n   - What debates or discussions paved the way?\n\n6. **POWER ARRANGEMENTS**: What power configurations enable/constrain?\n   - Who benefits from the current arrangement?\n   - Who is constrained or excluded?\n   - What type of power is operating (sovereign, disciplinary, biopolitical)?\n\n7. **EXCLUSIONS**: What is rendered impossible or unthinkable?\n   - What alternatives are suppressed?\n   - What cannot be said within this discourse?\n\n\nThink genealogically - trace the conditions that had to exist for this to be thinkable.\n",

  "concretization_prompt": "\nTransform the conditions analysis to use concrete, specific names:\n\n1. Name phenomena specifically:\n   - \"P1\" -> \"Algorithmic Credit Scoring Discourse\"\n\n2. Name conditions concretely:\n   - \"EC1\" -> \"Statistical Probability Theory (post-18th century)\"\n   - \"IC1\" -> \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\"\n   - \"MC1\" -> \"Big Data Infrastructure and Cloud Computing\"\n\n3. Name power arrangements specifically:\n   - Include who actually benefits and is constrained\n\n4. Name exclusions concretely:\n   - What specific alternatives are suppressed?\n\nPreserve all relationships and analytical depth.\nMake the genealogy immediately useful for critical analysis.\n",
