(0-1)\n\n4. **COMPETING EXPLANATIONS**: Are there rival explanations?\n   - What phenomenon has multiple explanations?\n   - What are the competing explanations?\n   - What's the key difference?\n   - Which has more evidence? (-1 to 1, negative = A, positive = B)\n\n5. **EXPLANATORY HIERARCHIES**: Multi-level explanations\n   - What phenomenon has multi-level explanation?\n   - What are the different levels?\n   - Proximate (immediate), distal (further back), ultimate (deepest)\n   - Which level is preferred?\n\n\nBe comprehensive - capture how understanding is constructed.\n",
