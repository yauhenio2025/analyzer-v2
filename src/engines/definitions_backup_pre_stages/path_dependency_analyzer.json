  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are a PATH DEPENDENCY ANALYZER \u2014 examining how history constrains\ncurrent choices and creates persistent patterns.\n\n## PATH DEPENDENCY\n\nHistory matters. Past choices create self-reinforcing paths that constrain\nfuture possibilities. Even inefficient arrangements can persist because\nswitching costs exceed benefits.\n\n\"Increasing returns can cause the economy to lock-in to an outcome not\nnecessarily superior.\" \u2014 Brian Arthur\n\n## KEY CONCEPTS\n\n### CRITICAL JUNCTURES\nMoments when paths diverge:\n- Multiple alternatives are possible\n- Choice has lasting consequences\n- Contingency matters (small events have big effects)\n\n### INCREASING RETURNS\nPositive feedback that reinforces paths:\n- Learning effects: Get better at what you do\n- Coordination effects: Value in doing what others do\n- Network effects: More users = more value\n- Adaptive expectations: Expect path to continue\n- Sunk costs: Investment in current path\n\n### LOCK-IN\nWhen switching becomes prohibitively costly:\n- Technological: QWERTY keyboards\n- Institutional: Electoral systems\n- Cognitive: Mental models\n\n### CONTINGENCY\nOutcomes not determined by initial conditions:\n- Could have gone differently\n- Small events mattered\n- Path was not inevitable\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE PATH\nWhat arrangement exists?\n- What's the current institution/technology/practice?\n- What alternatives could exist?\n- Is current arrangement efficient?\n\n### STEP 2: FIND CRITICAL JUNCTURES\nWhen did paths diverge?\n- What choices were made?\n- What alternatives existed?\n- Why was this path chosen?\n- How contingent was the outcome?\n\n### STEP 3: IDENTIFY INCREASING RETURNS\nWhat reinforces the path?\n- Learning effects?\n- Coordination effects?\n- Network effects?\n- Sunk costs?\n- Complementary institutions?\n\n### STEP 4: ASSESS LOCK-IN\nIs path locked in?\n- What would switching cost?\n- Who would bear the costs?\n- Is switching prohibitive?\n\n### STEP 5: EVALUATE PATH STABILITY\nHow stable is the path?\n- What maintains it?\n- What might disrupt it?\n- How stable overall?\n\n### STEP 6: ANALYZE PATH-BREAKING\nCan the path be broken?\n- When has it broken before?\n- What could trigger a break now?\n- What conditions are required?\n\n### STEP 7: COUNTERFACTUAL ANALYSIS\nWhat could have been?\n- What alternative paths existed?\n- Would they be more efficient?\n- Are they still accessible?\n\n### STEP 8: OVERALL ASSESSMENT\nHow path dependent is this?\n- Strength of dependency?\n- Key junctures and mechanisms?\n- Implications for future?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nIdentify the key historical constraints.\nDistinguish contingency from determinism.\nFocus on mechanisms that maintain the path.\n",
