  "researcher_question": "Have these findings been replicated?",
  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are assessing REPLICATION STATUS \u2014 whether findings have been replicated\nand what this means for their robustness.\n\n## THE REPLICATION CRISIS CONTEXT\n\nMany published findings fail to replicate:\n- Psychology: ~40% replication rate in major study\n- Medicine: Many effects shrink in replication\n- Economics: ~50% replication rate\n- Cancer biology: Majority don't replicate\n\nThis means: Published doesn't mean reliable. Replication evidence matters.\n\n## TYPES OF REPLICATION\n\n### DIRECT REPLICATION\nSame method, new sample\n- Strongest test of finding\n- If fails, original finding questionable\n\n### CONCEPTUAL REPLICATION\nDifferent method, same concept\n- Tests whether concept is robust\n- If fails, may be method-specific\n\n### META-ANALYSIS\nSynthesizes multiple studies\n- Can reveal whether effect is real and how large\n- Publication bias can inflate effects\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY KEY FINDINGS\nWhat findings are being relied on?\n- What does each claim?\n- Where was it originally published?\n- What's the original effect size?\n\n### STEP 2: SEARCH FOR REPLICATION EVIDENCE\nFor each finding:\n- Has it been directly replicated?\n- Has it been conceptually replicated?\n- Are there failed replications?\n- Is there a meta-analysis?\n\nFor each replication attempt:\n- What type of replication?\n- What was the outcome?\n- How does the effect compare to original?\n- What's the methodological quality?\n\n### STEP 3: ASSESS EFFECT SHRINKAGE\nDo effects get smaller in replications?\n- Original effect size vs. replication effect sizes\n- This is common and informative\n\n### STEP 4: IDENTIFY UNTESTED FINDINGS\nWhat findings have no replication evidence?\n- How concerning is this?\n- How feasible would replication be?\n- What's the replication priority?\n\n### STEP 5: ASSESS ROBUSTNESS\nFor each finding:\n- Robust: Consistently replicated\n- Probably robust: Some successful replications\n- Uncertain: Mixed evidence\n- Probably fragile: More failures than successes\n- Fragile: Consistently fails to replicate\n\n### STEP 6: MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS\nHow much should we trust each finding?\n- Trust: Robust replication evidence\n- Trust cautiously: Some positive evidence\n- Await replication: Untested\n- Be skeptical: Mixed or failed replications\n- Disregard: Consistently fails to replicate\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about replication evidence. \"Probably replicated\" is not useful.\n\"Three direct replications, two successful, one failed, average effect 60% of original\" is useful.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing replication status assessments across multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. AGGREGATE REPLICATION EVIDENCE\n- Combine replication information across sources\n- What's the complete picture of replications?\n\n### 2. IDENTIFY ROBUST VS. FRAGILE FINDINGS\n- Which findings are consistently replicated?\n- Which consistently fail?\n- Which are untested?\n\n### 3. ASSESS FIELD-LEVEL PATTERNS\n- What's the overall replication rate?\n- What predicts successful replication?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive replication assessment for all key findings.\n",
