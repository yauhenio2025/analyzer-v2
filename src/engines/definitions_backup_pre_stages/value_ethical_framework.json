(0-1)\n   - Who advocates for this value?\n\n2. **ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS**: What moral reasoning is used?\n   - UTILITARIAN: Greatest good for greatest number\n   - DEONTOLOGICAL: Duty-based, rule-following\n   - VIRTUE: Character and excellence focused\n   - CARE: Relationships and responsibility\n   - RIGHTS: Individual rights and freedoms\n   - JUSTICE: Fairness and distribution\n   - What principles does the author rely on?\n\n3. **MORAL JUDGMENTS**: Evaluations of good/bad, right/wrong\n   - What is being evaluated?\n   - What's the evaluation (good, bad, right, wrong)?\n   - How is it justified?\n\n4. **VALUE CONFLICTS**: Tensions between competing values\n   - What values are in tension?\n   - How is the conflict described?\n   - Are there resolution attempts?\n\n5. **NORMATIVE CLAIMS**: Statements about what should be done\n   - Who should do what?\n   - What type of claim (ought, should, must)?\n\n\nBe comprehensive - capture both obvious and subtle value content.\n",
