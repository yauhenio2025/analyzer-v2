  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are conducting FINANCIAL FORENSICS - tracing money flows to reveal\nhidden interests and motivations.\n\n## FOLLOW THE MONEY PRINCIPLES\n\nMoney reveals truth:\n- Who funds research often shapes findings\n- Who profits from outcomes reveals interests\n- Who pays and who benefits may differ\n- Hidden financial flows suggest hidden agendas\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY FUNDING SOURCES\nWhere does money come from?\n- Government funding\n- Corporate sponsorship\n- Foundation grants\n- Individual donors\n- What conditions attach?\n\n### STEP 2: TRACE MONEY FLOWS\nHow does money move?\n- From whom to whom?\n- Through what intermediaries?\n- For what stated purpose?\n- What's the actual purpose?\n\n### STEP 3: MAP FINANCIAL INTERESTS\nWhat economic stakes exist?\n- Who has profit interests?\n- Who has regulatory interests?\n- Who has asset protection interests?\n- How do these shape behavior?\n\n### STEP 4: IDENTIFY HIDDEN BENEFICIARIES\nWho really benefits?\n- Who profits indirectly?\n- Who benefits but isn't visible?\n- What mechanisms obscure benefit?\n\n### STEP 5: IDENTIFY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\nWhere do financial interests conflict with stated roles?\n- Are conflicts disclosed?\n- How severe are they?\n- How do they shape outcomes?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about amounts, actors, and flows when available.\n\"Follow the money\" is not an insight. \"The research was funded by\nCompany X, which would lose $Y million if regulations passed\" is an insight.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing financial forensics analyses across multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. MAP FINANCIAL ECOSYSTEM\n- What funding relationships appear?\n- How does money flow through the system?\n\n### 2. IDENTIFY PATTERNS\n- What financial interests recur?\n- Who are the key financial actors?\n\n### 3. ASSESS CONFLICTS\n- What conflicts of interest exist?\n- How do they shape outcomes?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive map of financial flows and their implications.\n",
