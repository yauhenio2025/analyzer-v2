  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are detecting EMERGENCE \u2014 system-level properties that arise from\ncomponent interactions but cannot be predicted from components alone.\n\n## THE EMERGENCE CONCEPT\n\n\"The whole is more than the sum of its parts\" \u2014 Aristotle\n\nEmergence occurs when:\n- Systems have properties that components lack\n- Behaviors arise from interactions, not individual actions\n- New phenomena appear at different scales\n- Understanding parts doesn't explain the whole\n\n## TYPES OF EMERGENCE\n\n### WEAK EMERGENCE\nProperties that are in principle derivable from components but practically\nunpredictable due to complexity:\n- Weather patterns from air molecules\n- Market prices from individual trades\n- Traffic jams from individual drivers\n\n### STRONG EMERGENCE\nProperties that are genuinely new and not even in principle reducible:\n- Consciousness from neurons (contested)\n- Life from chemistry (contested)\n- Meaning from symbols\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY SYSTEM COMPONENTS\nWhat are the parts of this system?\n- At what scale are we analyzing?\n- What can the parts do individually?\n- How do parts interact?\n\n### STEP 2: IDENTIFY EMERGENT PROPERTIES\nWhat properties exist at the system level but not component level?\n\nFor each candidate:\n- Does this property exist in individual components? (If yes, not emergent)\n- Does this property require interaction to exist?\n- Could you predict this from component properties alone?\n\nExamples to look for:\n- Collective behaviors (flocking, herding, market movements)\n- System-level functions (organizational culture, institutional memory)\n- Novel capabilities (language from neurons, intelligence from rules)\n- Pattern formation (self-organization, spontaneous order)\n\n### STEP 3: TRACE GENERATING MECHANISMS\nHow do interactions produce emergence?\n- What specific interactions generate this property?\n- What's the mechanism?\n- Can you identify the \"more\" that arises from \"mere\" interaction?\n\n### STEP 4: MAP SCALE TRANSITIONS\nWhere do new phenomena appear as you change scale?\n- What exists at micro level that disappears at macro?\n- What exists at macro level that doesn't exist at micro?\n- What's the transition mechanism?\n\n### STEP 5: IDENTIFY DOWNWARD CAUSATION\nHow do emergent properties affect components?\n- Does the system-level property constrain component behavior?\n- Do parts behave differently because of the whole they're in?\n\n### STEP 6: ASSESS IRREDUCIBILITY\nFor each emergent property:\n- Can it be fully explained by component properties?\n- Is the emergence \"weak\" (complex but reducible) or \"strong\" (genuinely new)?\n- What aspects resist reduction?\n\n### STEP 7: IMPLICATIONS\nWhat does emergence mean for:\n- Understanding this system?\n- Predicting its behavior?\n- Intervening effectively?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe careful: Not everything \"complex\" is emergent.\nFocus on properties that genuinely arise from interaction and wouldn't exist\nwithout the system context.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing emergence detection across multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. CONSOLIDATE EMERGENT PROPERTIES\n- Merge equivalent properties identified across sources\n- Note where sources agree/disagree on what's emergent\n- Identify properties only one source detects\n\n### 2. VALIDATE EMERGENCE CLAIMS\n- Do multiple sources confirm the same emergent properties?\n- Where do sources disagree on emergence vs. aggregation?\n- What's the strongest evidence for genuine emergence?\n\n### 3. MAP CROSS-SYSTEM PATTERNS\n- Do similar emergent properties appear in different systems?\n- Are there common emergence mechanisms?\n- What patterns in scale transitions?\n\n### 4. SYNTHESIZE IMPLICATIONS\n- What does multi-source analysis reveal about reducibility?\n- Where is emergence most consequential?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate a unified emergence map that distinguishes genuine emergence from\nmere complexity or aggregation.\n",
