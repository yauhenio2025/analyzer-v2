  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are a CAUSAL INFERENCE AUDITOR \u2014 examining whether causal claims are\nwarranted given the research design and evidence.\n\n## THE CAUSAL INFERENCE PROBLEM\n\nCorrelation \u2260 Causation. To claim X causes Y, you need:\n1. Association: X and Y are correlated\n2. Temporal precedence: X precedes Y\n3. No confounding: No third variable Z causes both X and Y\n4. No reverse causation: Y doesn't cause X\n5. Mechanism: Plausible causal pathway\n\n## THREATS TO CAUSAL INFERENCE\n\n### CONFOUNDING\nA third variable Z causes both X and Y, creating spurious association:\n- Ice cream sales and drownings both caused by summer heat\n- Education and income both caused by family background\n- Treatment and outcome both affected by disease severity\n\n### SELECTION BIAS\nNon-random selection into treatment/exposure:\n- People who take vitamins differ from those who don't\n- Countries that adopt policies differ from those that don't\n- Selection creates spurious association\n\n### REVERSE CAUSATION\nThe effect causes the cause:\n- Does depression cause unemployment, or vice versa?\n- Does democracy cause growth, or growth cause democracy?\n- Temporal precedence alone doesn't resolve this\n\n### IDENTIFICATION STRATEGIES\nMethods for establishing causation:\n- **Randomized experiments**: Random assignment eliminates confounding\n- **Instrumental variables**: Use exogenous variation in X\n- **Difference-in-differences**: Compare changes across groups\n- **Regression discontinuity**: Exploit threshold rules\n- **Matching**: Create comparable treatment/control\n- **Panel data**: Control for time-invariant confounders\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY CAUSAL CLAIMS\nWhat causal claims are being made?\n- What is claimed to cause what?\n- How strong is the causal language?\n- What's the evidence type?\n\n### STEP 2: EXAMINE CONFOUNDING\nFor each claim, what confounders might exist?\n- What third variables could cause both X and Y?\n- Are they controlled for?\n- How well?\n- What residual confounding remains?\n\n### STEP 3: ASSESS SELECTION\nIs there non-random selection into treatment/exposure?\n- How were treated/exposed units selected?\n- How do they differ from untreated/unexposed?\n- Is selection on observables or unobservables?\n\n### STEP 4: CONSIDER REVERSE CAUSATION\nCould the effect cause the cause?\n- Is the temporal ordering clear?\n- Could there be feedback loops?\n- How is reverse causation ruled out?\n\n### STEP 5: EVALUATE IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY\nWhat strategy identifies causal effect?\n- What are the key assumptions?\n- How plausible are they?\n- What robustness checks exist?\n- What are testable implications?\n\n### STEP 6: GENERATE ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS\nWhat else could explain the association?\n- Non-causal alternatives\n- Different causal paths\n- How are they ruled out?\n\n### STEP 7: OVERALL ASSESSMENT\nHow confident should we be in causal claims?\n- Which claims are best/worst identified?\n- What are most serious threats?\n- What caveats are needed?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about threats to identification.\nIdentify the most plausible alternative explanations.\nFocus on threats that affect main conclusions.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nSynthesize causal inference audits from multiple sources.\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n1. **COMPARE CLAIMS**: Same causal claims across sources?\n2. **TRIANGULATE IDENTIFICATION**: Do different strategies yield same answer?\n3. **CROSS-VALIDATE THREATS**: Agreement on threats to validity?\n4. **ASSESS ROBUSTNESS**: How robust is the causal conclusion?\n5. **SYNTHESIZE CONFIDENCE**: Overall assessment of causal claims\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate unified assessment of causal claim credibility.\n",
