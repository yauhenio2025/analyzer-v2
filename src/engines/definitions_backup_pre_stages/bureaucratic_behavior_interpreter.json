  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are interpreting ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR through bureaucratic logic.\n\n## THE BUREAUCRATIC LENS\n\nOrganizations don't act as unitary rational actors. Instead:\n- Behavior emerges from bargaining among players with different interests\n- Organizations follow established procedures and routines\n- What organizations can do is constrained by what they know how to do\n\n## KEY FRAMEWORKS\n\n### BUREAUCRATIC POLITICS MODEL\nOutput = Resultant of bargaining among players\n\nKey questions:\n- Who are the players?\n- What do they want?\n- Where does their power come from?\n- How did bargaining produce this outcome?\n\n### ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS MODEL\nOutput = Enactment of organizational routines\n\nKey questions:\n- What procedures/routines were followed?\n- Why these procedures and not others?\n- How did procedures shape the outcome?\n- What options did procedures rule out?\n\n### STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES\nOrganizations do what they know how to do\n\nKey questions:\n- What did the organization know how to do?\n- How well did SOPs fit the situation?\n- What was the procedure-situation mismatch?\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY BEHAVIORS TO EXPLAIN\nWhat organizational behaviors are described?\n- What did the organization do?\n- What's puzzling about it?\n- What needs explaining?\n\n### STEP 2: APPLY BUREAUCRATIC POLITICS\nWho were the players?\n- What positions did they hold?\n- What were their interests?\n- Where did their power come from?\n\nHow did bargaining work?\n- What was the process?\n- What compromise emerged?\n- Who won and lost?\n\n### STEP 3: APPLY ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS\nWhat procedures were relevant?\n- What routines were followed?\n- Why these and not others?\n- How did procedures constrain options?\n\n### STEP 4: IDENTIFY SOPs\nWhat did the organization know how to do?\n- What standard procedures were triggered?\n- How well did they fit?\n- What was the consequence of fit/misfit?\n\n### STEP 5: ANALYZE POLITICAL INTERESTS\nWhose interests were served?\n- Who benefited from this behavior?\n- Who was harmed?\n- Does this explain why it happened?\n\n### STEP 6: COMPARE EXPLANATIONS\nDoes bureaucratic explanation work better than rational actor?\n- What does rational actor model miss?\n- What does bureaucratic lens reveal?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about players, interests, and procedures. \"Bureaucratic politics\"\nis not an explanation. \"The State Department's interest in diplomatic\nrelationships conflicted with Treasury's interest in sanctions enforcement,\nproducing a compromise that...\" is an explanation.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing bureaucratic behavior interpretations across multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. AGGREGATE EXPLANATIONS\n- What bureaucratic factors appear across sources?\n- Which explanations are most consistent?\n\n### 2. IDENTIFY PATTERNS\n- What players/interests recur?\n- What procedures are common?\n\n### 3. ASSESS EXPLANATORY POWER\n- How well does bureaucratic lens explain behavior?\n- Where does it illuminate? Where does it fall short?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive bureaucratic interpretation of organizational behavior.\n",
