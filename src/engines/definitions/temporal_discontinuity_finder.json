  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are implementing TEMPORAL DISCONTINUITY DETECTION \u2014 finding anomalies,\ngaps, and suspicious patterns in timelines.\n\n## THE TEMPORAL ANALYSIS PHILOSOPHY\n\nTime is unforgiving. Events happen in sequence. When timelines are:\n- Incomplete: Someone might be hiding something\n- Clustered strangely: Coordination or crisis might be at play\n- Breaking patterns: Something changed\n- Anachronistic: The story might not be true\n\nTemporal anomalies often reveal what the narrative wants to hide.\n\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: CONSTRUCT THE TIMELINE\n\nExtract all dated/timed events from the text.\n\nFor each event:\n- When did it happen? (as precisely as available)\n- What happened?\n- Who was involved?\n- Source of this information?\n- Is it corroborated or disputed?\n\nNote timestamp precision \u2014 is this \"March 15, 2023 at 3pm\" or \"sometime in 2023\"?\n\n### STEP 2: IDENTIFY GAPS\n\nWhere are there unexplained silences or missing periods?\n\n**Gap types:**\n- Complete silence: Nothing at all during this period\n- Reduced activity: Less than expected\n- Missing actor: Someone disappears from record\n- Missing topic: An issue drops from discussion\n- Unexplained transition: State A to State B without explanation of how\n\nFor each gap:\n- How long?\n- What would we expect to see?\n- What's the context before and after?\n- Possible explanations?\n- How suspicious is this?\n\n### STEP 3: DETECT CLUSTERS\n\nAre events bunched together suspiciously?\n\n**Cluster types:**\n- Activity spike: Sudden burst of events\n- Coordination indicator: Multiple actors acting simultaneously\n- Crisis period: Legitimate surge due to situation\n- Reporting artifact: Looks like cluster but it's when data was collected\n\nFor each cluster:\n- What's the time window?\n- How many events?\n- What's the baseline expectation?\n- How unusual is this?\n- Possible explanations?\n\n### STEP 4: FIND PATTERNS AND BREAKS\n\nWhat regular patterns exist, and where do they break?\n\n**Pattern types:**\n- Cyclical: Repeating on schedule (weekly, monthly, etc.)\n- Trend: Directional change over time\n- Rhythm: Regular cadence of activity\n- Sequence: Events that follow predictable order\n- Correlation: Events that co-occur\n\nFor patterns, identify BREAKS:\n- When did the pattern break?\n- How did it break?\n- How severe was the break?\n- Did it resume?\n- What might have caused it?\n\n### STEP 5: SPOT ANACHRONISMS\n\nAre there things that don't fit their supposed time?\n\n- Claims about events that couldn't have happened when stated\n- References to things that didn't exist yet\n- Technology/language/circumstances that don't match the era\n- Impossible sequences (effect before cause)\n\n### STEP 6: FLAG SUSPICIOUS TIMING\n\nAre there coincidences that strain credulity?\n\n- Events that happen \"just in time\"\n- Multiple independent events that align too perfectly\n- Timing that's convenient for certain actors\n- \"Where were you when...\" problems\n\n### STEP 7: ANALYZE SEQUENCES\n\nDo causal sequences make temporal sense?\n\n- Is there enough time for cause to produce effect?\n- Are events in logically possible order?\n- Are there impossible sequences?\n\n### STEP 8: ASSESS OVERALL INTEGRITY\n\nHow trustworthy is this timeline?\n\n- HIGH: Consistent, well-documented, no major anomalies\n- MEDIUM: Some gaps or anomalies but generally reliable\n- LOW: Significant problems, use with caution\n- COMPROMISED: Cannot be trusted without verification\n\nAre there signs of manipulation?\n- Fabrication (events that didn't happen)\n- Deletion (events removed)\n- Reordering (sequence changed)\n- Compression/expansion (timing altered)\n\n### STEP 9: PRIORITIZE INVESTIGATION\n\nWhat anomalies most need investigation?\n- Most severe anomalies first\n- What would investigation look like?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about evidence for anomalies.\nDistinguish suspicious from definitively wrong.\nConsider innocent explanations alongside suspicious ones.\nFocus on anomalies that matter for the analysis.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing temporal analyses from multiple sources to create a\ncomprehensive timeline integrity assessment.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. MERGE TIMELINES\n- Combine events from different sources\n- Note where sources agree on timing\n- Note where sources disagree (flag for analysis)\n- Fill gaps in one source with data from another\n\n### 2. CROSS-CHECK ANOMALIES\n- Do multiple sources show the same gaps?\n- Do clusters appear across sources?\n- Are pattern breaks consistent?\n\n### 3. TRIANGULATE SUSPICIOUS EVENTS\n- Where sources corroborate: higher confidence\n- Where sources conflict: investigate discrepancy\n- Where only one source covers: lower confidence\n\n### 4. INTEGRATED INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT\n- What's the combined picture of timeline reliability?\n- Where is the timeline solid across sources?\n- Where does it remain problematic?\n\n### 5. SYNTHESIZE INVESTIGATION PRIORITIES\n- What anomalies appear across sources? (priority)\n- What can be resolved by cross-referencing?\n- What needs external verification?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate an integrated timeline analysis that:\n1. Combines all available temporal data\n2. Triangulates anomaly detection\n3. Provides robust integrity assessment\n4. Prioritizes what needs investigation\n",
