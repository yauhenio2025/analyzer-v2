  "description": "Deep analysis of how early choices and historical sequences constrain later possibilities. Grounded in Pierson's increasing returns theory, North's institutional economics, Arthur's lock-in mechanisms, and Mahoney's critical juncture methodology. Reveals why suboptimal arrangements persist, how small early events produce outsized long-term effects, when path-breaking change becomes possible, and what makes some institutions sticky while others evolve. Essential for understanding historical inefficiency, timing effects, and the difference between paths that could have been different versus those that were overdetermined.",

        "STEP 2: ESTABLISH ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS - Map what existed before each juncture. Following Pierson, distinguish between conditions that were themselves path-dependent (from earlier sequences) versus those exogenous to the process. These set the stage but don't determine outcomes.",
        "STEP 3: SEPARATE PERMISSIVE FROM PRODUCTIVE CONDITIONS - Following Mahoney's causal analysis: Permissive conditions (PC) loosen constraints and create openings but don't directly cause change. Productive conditions (PDC) actively generate outcomes. A crisis might be permissive; actor mobilization is productive.",
        "STEP 4: MAP CONJUNCTURES - Identify where multiple independent causal streams converged. Following Pierson: path dependence often emerges from the intersection of processes, not single causes. Ask: What came together here? Would each stream alone have produced this outcome?",
        "STEP 5: TRACE INCREASING RETURNS SOURCES - Apply Arthur's four sources: (1) Large setup/fixed costs creating scale economies (2) Learning effects deepening expertise with use (3) Coordination effects making alignment valuable (4) Adaptive expectations creating self-fulfilling prophecies. Identify which operate on each path.",
        "STEP 6: IDENTIFY LOCK-IN MECHANISMS - Beyond increasing returns, map political lock-in per Pierson: institutional density, veto points, asset specificity, collective action problems, power asymmetries, legitimation. What makes exit costly even when the path is suboptimal?",
        "STEP 7: CALCULATE SWITCHING COSTS - Enumerate what would have to be paid to transition: sunk investments lost, coordination costs, political opposition, uncertainty costs, identity costs. Who bears these costs? This explains persistence even with recognized inefficiency.",
        "STEP 8: TRACE SELF-REINFORCING SEQUENCES - Map sequences where each step reinforces the previous pattern. Following Mahoney: institutional reproduction through utilitarian, functional, power, or legitimation mechanisms. Identify the reproduction logic.",
        "STEP 9: TRACE REACTIVE SEQUENCES - Map chains where each event is a reaction to preceding events. Unlike self-reinforcing sequences, these can transform rather than reproduce. Identify the chain logic: backlash, unintended consequences, adaptation.",
        "STEP 10: IDENTIFY CONTINGENT EVENTS - Find 'small' events with outsized effects. Apply Arthur's test: Was the event determined by prior conditions? If not, but it had major consequences, this is genuine contingency. Document the amplification mechanism.",
        "STEP 11: ASSESS PATH ALTERNATIVES - For each juncture, identify paths not taken. Were they genuinely viable? Who supported them? What foreclosed them? This establishes counterfactual benchmark for assessing current path efficiency.",
        "STEP 12: IDENTIFY QWERTY EFFECTS - Look for suboptimal lock-in following Arthur. Are there more efficient alternatives that switching costs block? Document the inefficiency trap: what's lost, who's harmed, why it persists.",
        "STEP 13: MAP INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES - Apply Streeck/Thelen typology: Layering (new elements added without removing old), Conversion (old forms repurposed), Drift (context changes while rules stay same), Displacement (new models marginalize old). These show how paths evolve without breaking.",
        "STEP 14: ANALYZE PATH-BREAKING ATTEMPTS - For each effort to exit the path, analyze: What was attempted? What obstacles were faced? Why did it succeed/fail? Following Pierson, path-breaking requires either major external shock or gradual accumulation of pressures that overcome lock-in.",
