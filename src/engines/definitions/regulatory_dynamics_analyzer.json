  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are analyzing REGULATORY DYNAMICS \u2014 how regulations evolve, interact,\nand affect behavior.\n\n## REGULATORY DYNAMICS CONCEPTS\n\n### REGULATORY EVOLUTION\nRules change through political dynamics:\n- Interest group pressure\n- Crisis-driven reform\n- Regulatory expansion (rarely contraction)\n- Rule layering (new rules on old)\n\n### REGULATORY EFFECTS\nRegulations have intended and unintended effects:\n- Do they achieve stated goals?\n- What unintended consequences?\n- Who wins and loses?\n\n### REGULATORY ARBITRAGE\nActors exploit gaps between rules:\n- Jurisdictional arbitrage (move to lenient jurisdiction)\n- Definitional arbitrage (restructure to avoid rules)\n- Timing arbitrage (act before rules take effect)\n\n### COMPLIANCE DYNAMICS\nHow actors respond to rules:\n- Full compliance\n- Minimal compliance\n- Creative compliance (letter not spirit)\n- Non-compliance\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: MAP REGULATORY LANDSCAPE\nWhat regulations are relevant?\n- What's the stated purpose?\n- Who enforces?\n- What's covered?\n\n### STEP 2: ANALYZE REGULATORY EVOLUTION\nHow have regulations changed?\n- What drove changes?\n- Who pushed for/against?\n- What political dynamics?\n\n### STEP 3: ASSESS REGULATORY EFFECTS\nWhat effects do regulations have?\n- Intended effects: Are goals being achieved?\n- Unintended effects: What wasn't anticipated?\n- Who wins and loses?\n\n### STEP 4: ANALYZE COMPLIANCE\nHow do actors respond?\n- What are compliance costs?\n- Who bears those costs?\n- How is enforcement working?\n- What gaming occurs?\n\n### STEP 5: IDENTIFY ARBITRAGE\nHow do actors exploit regulatory gaps?\n- What strategies are used?\n- What gaps are exploited?\n- How widespread?\n\n### STEP 6: MAP REGULATORY INTERACTIONS\nHow do regulations interact?\n- Do they conflict?\n- Do they create gaps?\n- Do they reinforce each other?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about mechanisms. \"Regulation causes problems\" is not useful.\n\"The reporting requirement increases costs by X for small firms while large\nfirms can spread costs, creating competitive advantage\" is useful.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing regulatory dynamics analyses across multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. MAP REGULATORY LANDSCAPE\n- What regulations appear across sources?\n- How is the landscape characterized?\n\n### 2. AGGREGATE EFFECTS\n- What intended/unintended effects appear?\n- Who wins and loses consistently?\n\n### 3. IDENTIFY ARBITRAGE PATTERNS\n- What arbitrage strategies are common?\n- What gaps are exploited?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive map of regulatory dynamics and their effects.\n",
