  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are implementing INDICATIONS & WARNINGS (I&W) methodology \u2014 the approach\nto early warning and strategic monitoring.\n\n## THE I&W PHILOSOPHY\n\nWe cannot predict the future. But we CAN:\n1. Define what SIGNS would indicate a particular future is unfolding\n2. WATCH for those signs systematically\n3. ASSESS whether the signs are appearing\n4. FLAG when signs cross thresholds requiring attention\n\nGoal: Be prepared, not surprised.\n\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY SCENARIOS TO MONITOR\n\nWhat key outcomes, events, or situations does this text suggest we should watch for?\n\nFor each scenario:\n- What is it? (clear description)\n- Why does it matter? (significance)\n- How likely does it currently appear?\n\nInclude:\n- Scenarios the text explicitly discusses\n- Scenarios implied but not stated\n- Negative scenarios (things we hope don't happen)\n- Positive scenarios (opportunities to watch for)\n\n### STEP 2: DEFINE SIGNPOSTS\n\nFor each scenario, what observable events/conditions would indicate it's unfolding?\n\n**Signpost Types:**\n- **Leading indicators**: Would appear BEFORE the scenario fully manifests\n- **Coincident indicators**: Would appear AS the scenario unfolds\n- **Lagging indicators**: Would confirm AFTER the scenario has occurred\n\n**For each signpost, specify:**\n- What exactly to look for (be specific and observable)\n- How observable is it?\n- How reliable is it?\n- Threshold for concern (when to pay closer attention)\n- Threshold for action (when to respond)\n\n### STEP 3: EXTRACT CURRENT INDICATOR STATUS\n\nBased on evidence in the text, what is the current status of each indicator?\n\n**Status levels:**\n- Not present: No evidence of this indicator\n- Emerging: Weak or initial signs\n- Partially present: Some evidence, incomplete\n- Present: Clear evidence\n- Strongly present: Overwhelming evidence\n\n**Track the trend:**\n- Stable: Not changing\n- Increasing: Getting stronger\n- Decreasing: Getting weaker\n- Volatile: Fluctuating\n- Unknown: Can't assess direction\n\n### STEP 4: ASSESS SIGNPOST STATUS\n\nFor each signpost, roll up the indicators:\n- How many indicators are triggered?\n- Has it crossed the concern threshold?\n- Has it crossed the action threshold?\n\n### STEP 5: OVERALL WARNING ASSESSMENT\n\nSynthesize across all signposts:\n- Overall posture: NORMAL / ELEVATED / HIGH / CRITICAL\n- Trajectory: STABLE / ESCALATING / DE-ESCALATING / MIXED\n\n### STEP 6: MONITORING REQUIREMENTS\n\nPrioritize what to watch:\n- What's most important to monitor?\n- How frequently?\n\n### STEP 7: IDENTIFY TRIPWIRES\n\nWhat combinations of indicators should trigger automatic response?\n\n### STEP 8: GAP ANALYSIS\n\nWhat CAN'T we monitor? Blind spots? Access limitations?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about observables. \"Watch for political instability\" is too vague.\n\"Watch for three or more cabinet resignations within 30 days\" is actionable.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing early warning analyses from multiple sources to create a\ncomprehensive monitoring framework.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. CONSOLIDATE SCENARIOS\n- Merge equivalent scenarios from different sources\n- Identify scenarios mentioned by multiple sources (higher priority)\n- Note scenarios only one source identifies\n\n### 2. INTEGRATE SIGNPOSTS\n- Combine signposts for the same scenarios\n- Look for leading, coincident, and lagging indicators across sources\n- Identify where sources agree/disagree on what to watch\n\n### 3. TRIANGULATE INDICATOR STATUS\n- Where multiple sources assess the same indicator, compare assessments\n- Higher confidence where sources agree\n- Flag discrepancies for investigation\n\n### 4. COMPREHENSIVE WARNING PICTURE\n- Roll up all signpost assessments\n- Assess overall posture across the full scenario space\n- Identify trajectory considering all evidence\n\n### 5. PRIORITIZED MONITORING\n- What's most important to watch across all scenarios?\n- Where do gaps exist across sources?\n- What are the critical tripwires?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate a unified warning framework that:\n1. Covers all identified scenarios\n2. Provides specific, observable signposts\n3. Tracks current indicator status with confidence\n4. Assesses overall warning posture\n5. Prioritizes monitoring requirements\n",
