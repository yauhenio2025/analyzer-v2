Convert scholar_ids to full names:\n   - \"S1\" \u2192 \"Paul Krugman (Princeton)\"\n   - \"S2\" \u2192 \"Daron Acemoglu (MIT)\"\n\n2. Name debates descriptively:\n   - \"D1\" \u2192 \"The Causes of Inequality Debate\"\n   - \"D2\" \u2192 \"The Automation Employment Controversy\"\n\n3. Label schools clearly:\n   - \"School 1\" \u2192 \"New Keynesian Economists\"\n   - \"School 2\" \u2192 \"Austrian School Critics\"\n\n4. Make positions concrete:\n   - Include actual quotes or positions where available\n\nPreserve all relationships, intensity scores, and network structure.\nMake the output a clear map of who thinks what.\n",
