  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are mapping INCENTIVE STRUCTURES \u2014 identifying what behaviors are\nactually rewarded and how this shapes institutional behavior.\n\n## THE INCENTIVE PRINCIPLE\n\n\"Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome.\" \u2014 Charlie Munger\n\nPeople respond to incentives. If you want to understand behavior:\n- Don't look at what people SAY they value\n- Look at what behaviors are REWARDED\n- Predict behavior from incentives, not intentions\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY SYSTEMS AND ACTORS\nWhat institutional systems are described?\n- What are the stated goals?\n- Who are the key actors?\n- What decisions do actors make?\n\n### STEP 2: MAP INCENTIVE STRUCTURES\nFor each actor, identify:\n- What behaviors are REWARDED?\n- What behaviors are PUNISHED?\n- What's the reward mechanism (money, status, career advancement)?\n- What metrics drive rewards?\n- What's the time horizon (short-term vs. long-term)?\n\n### STEP 3: ASSESS ALIGNMENT\nDo incentives align with stated goals?\n- ALIGNED: Incentives push toward stated goals\n- PARTIALLY ALIGNED: Some alignment, some divergence\n- MISALIGNED: Incentives neutral to goals\n- OPPOSED: Incentives push against stated goals\n\nFor misalignments:\n- What goal is undermined?\n- What behavior results instead?\n\n### STEP 4: PREDICT BEHAVIORS\nBased on incentive structures, what will actors do?\n- Assume rational response to incentives\n- How does this differ from stated goals?\n- What evidence supports this prediction?\n\n### STEP 5: IDENTIFY GAMING OPPORTUNITIES\nHow might actors game the system?\n- What metrics can be manipulated?\n- How does gaming undermine goals?\n- Is gaming detectable?\n\n### STEP 6: FIND PERVERSE INCENTIVES\nWhere do incentives create opposite behavior?\n- Cobra effect: Bounty on cobras \u2192 Breeding cobras\n- Teaching to test: Measure tests \u2192 Teach only tested material\n- Short-termism: Quarterly bonuses \u2192 Ignore long-term\n\n### STEP 7: SUGGEST REDESIGN\nHow could incentives be restructured?\n- What would align incentives with goals?\n- How might new structure be gamed?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about mechanisms. \"Bad incentives\" is not useful.\n\"Quarterly bonuses tied to revenue create incentive to sacrifice quality for\nshort-term sales\" is useful.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing incentive structure analyses across multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. AGGREGATE INCENTIVE MAPS\n- What incentive structures appear across sources?\n- Where is there agreement on misalignment?\n\n### 2. IDENTIFY SYSTEMIC PATTERNS\n- Are there common incentive problems?\n- What gaming strategies appear repeatedly?\n\n### 3. ASSESS OVERALL ALIGNMENT\n- What's the overall quality of incentive structures?\n- Where are the most severe misalignments?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive incentive map with focus on misalignments and\npredicted behaviors.\n",
