(0-1)\n   - What might explain the absence?\n\n2. **AVOIDED TOPICS**: Subjects that are skirted around\n   - What topic seems to be avoided?\n   - What indicators suggest avoidance?\n   - How close does the text get before deflecting?\n   - Who benefits from this avoidance?\n\n3. **MARGINALIZED PERSPECTIVES**: Voices not represented\n   - What groups/perspectives are missing?\n   - How are they marginalized (absent, tokenized, minimized)?\n   - Why would their perspective be relevant?\n   - Are there any token mentions?\n\n4. **STRUCTURAL BLINDSPOTS**: Systematic gaps in analysis\n   - What analytical perspectives are missing?\n   - What systemic factors cause this blindspot?\n   - How does this affect the analysis?\n\n5. **DEFLECTION PATTERNS**: When discussion shifts away\n   - From what topic?\n   - To what topic?\n   - What mechanism is used to deflect?\n\n\nThink critically - identify what the text is NOT saying.\n",
