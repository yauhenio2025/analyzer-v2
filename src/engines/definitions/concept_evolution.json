  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in conceptual analysis tracking how terms evolve.\n\nFor this article, extract ALL concept-related information:\n\n## KEY CONCEPTS\nIdentify the important terms/concepts and for each:\n1. **TERM**: The word or phrase\n2. **IMPORTANCE**: Core (central to argument), supporting, or peripheral\n3. **DEFINITION(S)**: How is it defined?\n   - Explicit: Author provides definition\n   - Operational: Defined by how it's used/measured\n   - Implicit: Meaning inferred from context\n4. **AUTHOR**: Who defines it this way? (if attributed)\n5. **DATE**: When? (if temporal context available)\n\n## SEMANTIC FIELD\nFor important concepts:\n- What related terms cluster with it?\n- What terms are treated as synonymous?\n- What terms are contrasted with it?\n\n## DEFINITIONAL TENSIONS\nIdentify where:\n- The same term is defined differently\n- Definitions are contested\n- Narrow vs. broad uses conflict\n- Technical vs. colloquial meanings differ\n\n## CONCEPTUAL ORIGINS\nIf discussed:\n- Where does this concept come from?\n- Who introduced it? When?\n- How has it changed from original meaning?\n- What earlier concepts does it build on?\n\n\nBe thorough - concepts are the building blocks of arguments.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing concept analyses from multiple articles into a unified conceptual map.\n\nYour task:\n1. **CONSOLIDATE CONCEPTS**: Merge same concept across articles\n   - Collect all definitions\n   - Note definitional variations\n   - Track frequency and importance\n\n2. **MAP VARIATIONS**:\n   - Where do definitions diverge?\n   - What type of variation is it?\n   - How contested is the concept?\n\n3. **TRACE EVOLUTION**:\n   - If temporal data exists, track meaning changes\n   - What triggers semantic shifts?\n   - What's the current stable meaning (if any)?\n\n4. **BUILD GENEALOGIES**:\n   - Which concepts derive from others?\n   - What are the intellectual lineages?\n   - Where do concepts split or merge?\n\n5. **CLUSTER SEMANTICALLY**:\n   - Group related concepts\n   - Identify conceptual families\n   - Map the semantic landscape\n\nCreate clear concept_ids (e.g., \"concept_sovereignty\", \"concept_innovation\").\n\n\nOutput a comprehensive map of conceptual terrain.\n",
  "concretization_prompt": "\nTransform the conceptual analysis to use concrete, recognizable labels:\n\n1. Convert concept_ids to actual terms:\n   - \"C1\" \u2192 \"Digital Sovereignty\"\n   - \"C2\" \u2192 \"Disruptive Innovation\"\n\n2. Name variations descriptively:\n   - \"V1\" \u2192 \"The 'Innovation' Definition Wars\"\n   - \"V2\" \u2192 \"Narrow vs. Broad AI Concepts\"\n\n3. Label evolutions clearly:\n   - \"E1\" \u2192 \"The Expanding Meaning of 'Platform'\"\n\n4. Name semantic clusters:\n   - \"Cluster 1\" \u2192 \"Governance Concepts\"\n   - \"Cluster 2\" \u2192 \"Market Dynamics Terms\"\n\nPreserve all definitions, relationships, and temporal sequences.\nMake the conceptual landscape immediately navigable.\n",
