  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are implementing RATIONAL ACTOR MODELING \u2014 profiling decision-makers to\npredict their behavior.\n\n## THE MODELING PHILOSOPHY\n\nActors are rational WITHIN THEIR OWN FRAME. They may have:\n- Different information than we do\n- Different values than we do\n- Different mental models than we do\n- Different constraints than we imagine\n\nTo predict behavior, model THEIR subjective reality, not our view of them.\n\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY KEY ACTORS\n\nWho are the decision-makers that matter in this context?\n- Individuals with power to act\n- Collective actors (organizations, groups)\n- Institutional actors\n\n### STEP 2: MAP WORLDVIEWS\n\nFor each actor, understand how THEY see the situation:\n\n**Core Beliefs:**\n- What are their fundamental assumptions about how the world works?\n- What values drive them?\n- What historical analogies do they draw on?\n\n**Threat Perception:**\n- What do they see as threatening?\n- How easily do they perceive threat?\n- What triggers their threat response?\n\n**Opportunity Perception:**\n- What opportunities do they see?\n- What gains are they pursuing?\n\n**In-Group/Out-Group:**\n- Who do they consider \"us\"?\n- Who is \"them\"?\n\n**Blind Spots:**\n- What do they systematically miss?\n- Why are they blind to it?\n\n### STEP 3: CHARACTERIZE DECISION STYLE\n\nHow do they make decisions?\n\n**Risk Tolerance:**\n- Risk-seeking, risk-neutral, or risk-averse?\n- Does it vary by domain?\n\n**Time Horizon:**\n- Short-term or long-term oriented?\n- How far ahead do they plan?\n\n**Information Processing:**\n- Analytical (data-driven) or intuitive?\n- Ideological (fits to framework) or pragmatic?\n- Open to new information or confirmation-biased?\n\n**Decision Mode:**\n- Decisive (quick, firm) or deliberative (slow, careful)?\n- Consultative (seeks input) or autocratic?\n- Willing to reverse course?\n\n**Consistency:**\n- Ideologically consistent or pragmatically flexible?\n- Predictable or surprising?\n\n**Under Pressure:**\n- Do they double down, escalate, compromise, or retreat?\n- What's their stress tolerance?\n\n### STEP 4: IDENTIFY CONSTRAINTS\n\nWhat limits their freedom of action?\n\n**Institutional:** Rules, procedures, checks on power\n**Political:** Coalition partners, opposition, power dynamics\n**Resource:** Money, personnel, capabilities\n**Domestic:** Public opinion, constituencies, internal politics\n**International:** Allies, adversaries, international law/norms\n**Personal:** Health, family, career concerns\n\nHow binding are these constraints? Can they be worked around?\n\n### STEP 5: ANALYZE TRACK RECORD\n\nWhat past decisions reveal about their patterns?\n- What did they decide?\n- What was the context?\n- What happened?\n- What does this reveal about their decision-making?\n- Is it consistent with the profile we've built?\n\n### STEP 6: MAP INFLUENCES\n\nWho/what influences their decisions?\n- Advisors\n- Constituencies\n- Ideology\n- Personal relationships\n- Institutional pressures\n\n### STEP 7: PREDICT RESPONSES\n\nFor key scenarios, what would they likely do?\n- Specify the scenario\n- Predict most likely response\n- Explain rationale (using the profile)\n- Note alternative possibilities\n- Identify red lines that would trigger different responses\n\n### STEP 8: MAP INTERACTIONS\n\nHow do key actors interact with each other?\n- Relationship type (alliance, rivalry, hierarchy)\n- Power differential\n- Trust level\n- Communication quality\n- Likely interaction patterns\n\n### STEP 9: COLLECTIVE DYNAMICS\n\nFor groups of actors:\n- Groupthink risk?\n- Factional divisions?\n- Veto players?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about evidence for assessments.\nDistinguish high-confidence profile elements from speculation.\nNote where profile is thin and more information would help.\nFocus on actionable predictions.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing actor profiles from multiple sources to create comprehensive\ndecision-maker models.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. MERGE ACTOR PROFILES\n- Combine information on same actors from different sources\n- Note where sources agree (higher confidence)\n- Note where sources disagree (flag for analysis)\n\n### 2. TRIANGULATE WORLDVIEWS\n- Do sources agree on how actors see the world?\n- Where do characterizations differ?\n- What's the combined picture?\n\n### 3. RECONCILE DECISION STYLES\n- Do sources describe consistent decision patterns?\n- Where do they differ?\n- Is there evolution over time?\n\n### 4. INTEGRATE TRACK RECORDS\n- Combine past decision data\n- Does combined record confirm or complicate profile?\n\n### 5. SYNTHESIZE PREDICTIONS\n- Do sources make similar predictions?\n- Where do they diverge?\n- What's the robust prediction?\n\n### 6. META-ANALYSIS\n- Which actors are consistently profiled?\n- Which actors remain opaque?\n- How does multi-source integration improve prediction?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive actor profiles that:\n1. Integrate multiple source perspectives\n2. Note confidence levels throughout\n3. Distinguish agreement from speculation\n4. Provide actionable predictions\n",
