  "description": "Pre-scanning classification step: quickly determines how each prior work relates to the current work. This enables Pass 2 to adapt its analysis strategy per prior work rather than treating all prior works identically. Designed to be fast and cheap (Sonnet, low thinking budget).",

  "kind": "extraction",
  "reasoning_domain": "genealogy_analysis",

The author's intellectual toolkit — how they think — was shaped by this work, even if the subject matter differs entirely.",

      "tangential": "Minimal meaningful connection to the current work. May share some vocabulary or broad thematic overlap but does not serve as precursor, contextualizer, or counter-position in any substantial way."
