Standard genealogical tracing applies. SIGNALS: shared vocabulary (same terms or precursor terms), similar methodological signatures, same metaphors, matching domain crossings.",
      "indirect_contextualizer": "Does NOT discuss the same topics as the current work, but contains foundational thinking, analytical methods, cognitive patterns, or frameworks that ENABLE the current argument. The author's intellectual toolkit — how they think — was shaped by this work, even if the subject matter differs entirely. SIGNALS: shared methodological signatures even with different subject matter, recurring analytical moves, same argumentative structures applied to different domains.",

The cross-domain transfer of methods, metaphors, structural analogies, or problem-solving approaches is the key connection. May also create blind spots. SIGNALS: the target work's domain_crossings reference this field, metaphors from this domain appear in the target work, structural analogies bridge the two domains.",
      "counter_position": "Prior work where the author held a position that is opposite to, or significantly different from, the current work. The SHIFT itself is the analytically interesting datum — what changed and how the author manages the reversal. SIGNALS: same vocabulary used with opposite valence, same evidence cited for different conclusions, framing shifts from tentative to definitive (or vice versa).",
      "tangential": "Minimal meaningful connection to the current work. May share some vocabulary or broad thematic overlap but does not serve as precursor, contextualizer, or counter-position in any substantial way. CLASSIFY AS TANGENTIAL ONLY IF: no vocabulary overlap, no methodological signature matches, no metaphor overlap, no relevant domain crossings."

You receive not just ideas but their vocabulary, methodological signatures, metaphors, framing choices, and domain crossings. USE ALL THESE DIMENSIONS for classification — don't just compare topics. Two works can share NO topics but have identical methodological signatures (= indirect_contextualizer). A work can be in a completely different field but be the SOURCE of a metaphor the author now uses centrally (= different_field_relevant). Vocabulary overlap is the strongest signal for direct_precursor. Methodological signature matches with different subject matter is the strongest signal for indirect_contextualizer. Err on the side of indirect_contextualizer rather than tangential when in doubt. The specific_ideas_to_trace and key_aspects_to_probe fields are critical — they tell Pass 2 exactly what to search for, making the deep scan far more precise."
