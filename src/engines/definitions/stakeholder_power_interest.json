  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are an expert policy analyst mapping stakeholder power and interests.\n\nFor this article, extract ALL stakeholders you can identify:\n\n1. **STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION**:\n   - Who are the actors mentioned or implied?\n   - Classify: government, corporation, NGO, academic, individual, coalition, media, international\n   - Include both direct participants and affected parties\n\n2. **POWER ASSESSMENT** (0-1 scale):\n   - What resources do they control? (money, authority, expertise, information, legitimacy)\n   - What constraints limit their power?\n   - How much can they influence outcomes?\n\n3. **INTEREST ASSESSMENT** (0-1 scale):\n   - What do they stand to gain or lose?\n   - Stated interests (explicitly mentioned)\n   - Inferred interests (implied by actions/context)\n\n4. **POSITION MAPPING**:\n   - Supporter, opponent, neutral, or ambivalent?\n   - On what specific issues?\n\n5. **RELATIONSHIPS**:\n   - Who allies with whom? Against whom?\n   - Dependencies (who needs whom?)\n   - Competition (who competes for what?)\n\n6. **POWER DYNAMICS**:\n   - Who wins, who loses in described scenarios?\n   - Through what mechanisms?\n\n\nBe comprehensive - include obvious major players AND less visible affected parties.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing stakeholder analyses from multiple articles into a unified power-interest map.\n\nYour task:\n1. **CONSOLIDATE STAKEHOLDERS**:\n   - Merge same stakeholders across articles\n   - Aggregate power/interest assessments (weighted average by evidence quality)\n   - Combine all stated and inferred interests\n\n2. **CALIBRATE SCORES**:\n   - Ensure power scores are consistent across stakeholders\n   - Ensure interest scores reflect relative stakes\n   - Adjust based on cross-article evidence\n\n3. **MAP RELATIONSHIPS**:\n   - Identify all alliance/opposition/dependency patterns\n   - Note where relationships are contested or evolving\n   - Rate strength based on evidence frequency and clarity\n\n4. **IDENTIFY COALITIONS**:\n   - Group stakeholders with aligned interests\n   - Calculate combined coalition power\n   - Name coalitions by their shared interest\n\n5. **DOCUMENT POWER DYNAMICS**:\n   - What patterns of winning/losing emerge?\n   - Through what mechanisms does power operate?\n   - Who benefits from status quo vs. change?\n\n6. **CALCULATE METRICS**:\n   - Conflict intensity: how opposed are stakeholder interests?\n   - Power concentration: how evenly distributed?\n   - Interest alignment: potential for coalition building\n\n\nOutput a comprehensive stakeholder map showing the political landscape of the issue.\n",
  "concretization_prompt": "\nTransform the stakeholder analysis to use concrete, recognizable labels:\n\n1.

Name coalitions descriptively:\n   - \"Coalition 1\" \u2192 \"Tech Industry Alliance\"\n   - \"Coalition 2\" \u2192 \"Consumer Protection Advocates\"\n\n3. Make power dynamics vivid:\n   - Use specific mechanisms: \"regulatory authority\", \"market dominance\", \"lobbying budget\"\n   - Name specific wins/losses\n\n4. Clarify relationships:\n   - Add context for why stakeholders are allied/opposed\n\nPreserve all scores, relationships, and evidence links.\nMake the output immediately recognizable to someone following the policy debate.\n",
