PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE\nStatistically significant \u2260 important or meaningful\n\n- With large N, tiny effects become statistically significant\n- A \"significant\" correlation of r = 0.05 explains 0.25% of variance\n- p < 0.05 doesn't mean 95% chance of being true\n\n### EFFECT SIZE MATTERS MORE THAN P-VALUE\nP-values depend on sample size; effect sizes don't.\n\nEffect size benchmarks (Cohen's d):\n- Small: d = 0.2 (hard to see without measurement)\n- Medium: d = 0.5 (visible to careful observer)\n- Large: d = 0.8 (obvious to naked eye)\n\n### P-HACKING\nAnalyzing data multiple ways until something is significant:\n- Testing many variables\n- Trying multiple analysis methods\n- Excluding inconvenient data points\n- Adding covariates until significance emerges\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY STATISTICAL CLAIMS\nWhat statistical significance claims are made?\n- What's the p-value?\n- What test was used?\n- What's the sample size?\n\n### STEP 2: ANALYZE EFFECT SIZES\nIs an effect size reported?\n- What type (d, r, OR, etc.)?\n- What's the magnitude?\n- Is this practically meaningful?\n\n### STEP 3: ASSESS PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE\nDoes statistical significance translate to real-world importance?\n- What does the effect mean in practice?\n- Would anyone notice this difference?\n- Is it worth caring about?\n\n### STEP 4: IDENTIFY P-HACKING RISKS\nAre there signs of analytical flexibility?\n- Many comparisons with few corrections?\n- Selective reporting of significant results?\n- Post-hoc hypotheses presented as confirmatory?\n- Lack of pre-registration?\n\n### STEP 5: INTERPRET CONFIDENCE INTERVALS\nIf CIs are reported:\n- How wide are they?\n- What does the range tell us?\n- Does the CI include zero/null?\n\n### STEP 6: ASSESS INTERPRETATION QUALITY\nAre findings properly interpreted?\n- Are there overstatements?\n- Is p-value misunderstood?\n- Are effect sizes ignored?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about what the numbers mean.\nThe goal is to separate statistical from practical significance.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing statistical significance interpretations across multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. COMPARE EFFECT SIZES\n- How do effect sizes compare across studies?\n- Is there consistency?\n\n### 2. AGGREGATE P-HACKING CONCERNS\n- Are there systematic concerns about analytical flexibility?\n- Which findings are most suspect?\n\n### 3. ASSESS OVERALL PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE\n- Which findings matter in practice?\n- Which are statistically significant but trivial?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate clear picture of what the statistics actually tell us.\n",

PRACTICAL**\n   - SC1: Statistically significant (p<0.01) but NOT practically significant\n     - Effect explains only [X]% of variance\n     - In practice: [Real-world meaning]\n\n4. **P-HACKING CONCERNS**\n   | Claim | Risk Level | Indicators |\n   |-------|------------|------------|\n   | SC1   | High       | [List]     |\n\n5. **CONFIDENCE INTERVALS**\n   - SC1: 95% CI [X, Y] \u2014 Very wide, estimate imprecise\n   - SC2: 95% CI [X, Y] \u2014 Includes zero, effect may be null\n\n6. **INTERPRETATION ISSUES**\n   - Claim: [What's claimed]\n   - Issue: [Overstatement or misinterpretation]\n   - Proper interpretation: [What should be said]\n\n7. **BOTTOM LINE**\n   [One paragraph: What do the statistics actually tell us?
