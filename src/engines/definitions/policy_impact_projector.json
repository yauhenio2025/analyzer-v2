AGGREGATE EFFECTS BY ORDER\n- What first-order effects appear across sources?\n- What second-order effects are projected?\n- What third-order effects are anticipated?\n\n### 2. IDENTIFY CONSENSUS AND DISAGREEMENT\n- Where do sources agree on effects?\n- Where do they disagree?\n\n### 3. ASSESS NET IMPACT\n- What's the overall projected impact?\n- Who are the net winners and losers?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive projection of policy effects across orders.\n",
