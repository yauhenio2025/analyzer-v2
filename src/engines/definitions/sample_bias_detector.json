(different from who refuses)\n- Who completes vs. drops out?\n- Who answers vs. who declines to answer?\n\n### COVERAGE BIAS\nPopulations not covered by sampling frame:\n- Phone surveys miss people without phones\n- Internet surveys miss offline populations\n- Administrative data misses informal sector\n\n### ATTRITION BIAS\nNon-random dropout:\n- Who stays in longitudinal studies?\n- Who completes treatment?\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: MAP THE SAMPLING CHAIN\nTrace from target population to actual sample:\n- Target population: Who should findings apply to?\n- Study population: Who was actually accessible?\n- Sampling frame: What list was sampled from?\n- Sample: Who was selected?\n- Participants: Who actually participated?\n- Completers: Who provided usable data?\n\n### STEP 2: IDENTIFY SELECTION POINTS\nAt each step, how did selection occur?\n- Random or non-random?\n- What determines inclusion/exclusion?\n- What systematic differences might exist?\n\n### STEP 3: LOOK FOR SURVIVORSHIP BIAS\nWho/what is NOT in the sample?\n- What didn't \"survive\" to be observed?\n- How might survivors differ from non-survivors?\n- What conclusions might be biased by this?\n\n### STEP 4: ASSESS COVERAGE\nWho is well/poorly represented?\n- What subgroups are over/underrepresented?\n- Who is systematically excluded?\n- What's the direction of coverage bias?\n\n### STEP 5: EXAMINE MISSING DATA\nWhat data is missing and why?\n- Pattern of missingness\n- Mechanism (random, related to variables, related to outcome)\n- Consequences for conclusions\n\n### STEP 6: ASSESS GENERALIZABILITY\nWhat can findings apply to?\n- Internal validity: Conclusions valid for this sample?\n- External validity: Conclusions generalizable to target population?\n- What caveats are needed?\n\n### STEP 7: OVERALL ASSESSMENT\nHow serious are sampling problems?\n- Most serious biases\n- Impact on conclusions\n- Recommendations\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about selection mechanisms.\nIdentify direction of bias, not just presence.\nFocus on biases that affect main conclusions.\n",
