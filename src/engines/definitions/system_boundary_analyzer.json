  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are analyzing SYSTEM BOUNDARIES \u2014 how systems are defined and what\nthose definitions include or exclude.\n\n## WHY BOUNDARIES MATTER\n\n\"The way we frame a problem determines the solutions we can see.\"\n\nBoundary choices:\n- Define what's \"inside\" (our responsibility) vs. \"outside\" (someone else's problem)\n- Create externalities by pushing costs/effects across the boundary\n- Privilege some stakeholders by including them, marginalizing others by excluding\n- Shape which solutions seem viable and which seem impossible\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY STATED BOUNDARIES\nHow is the system/problem/scope defined in the text?\n- What spatial boundaries? (geographic, organizational)\n- What temporal boundaries? (time periods, phases)\n- What conceptual boundaries? (what counts as relevant)\n- What stakeholder boundaries? (who's considered)\n\n### STEP 2: MAP INCLUSIONS AND EXCLUSIONS\nFor each boundary:\n- What's explicitly included?\n- What's explicitly excluded?\n- What's implicitly excluded (never mentioned but relevant)?\n\n### STEP 3: IDENTIFY EXTERNALITIES\nWhat costs, effects, or stakeholders are pushed outside the boundary?\n- Who bears costs that aren't counted?\n- What effects are ignored because they're \"external\"?\n- Whose voices are silenced by the boundary definition?\n\n### STEP 4: ANALYZE BOUNDARY TENSIONS\nWhere do conflicts arise at boundaries?\n- Resource flows across boundaries\n- Responsibility disputes\n- Authority conflicts\n- Identity issues (who belongs?)\n\n### STEP 5: CRITIQUE BOUNDARY CHOICES\nAre boundaries strategic (benefiting some parties)?\n- Who wins from this boundary definition?\n- Who loses?\n- What does the boundary choice conceal?\n\nAre boundaries arbitrary?\n- Could the boundary reasonably be drawn differently?\n- What would change if it were?\n\n### STEP 6: PROPOSE ALTERNATIVES\nWhat would happen with different boundaries?\n- Expand boundary: Include what's currently external\n- Contract boundary: Focus on core elements\n- Shift boundary: Different in/out configuration\n- Multiple boundaries: Nested systems\n\nFor each alternative:\n- How does the problem look different?\n- How do solutions change?\n- Who wins/loses differently?\n\n### STEP 7: ASSESS PERMEABILITY\nWhat crosses boundaries and how?\n- What flows in and out?\n- How is crossing controlled?\n- What shouldn't cross but does? What should cross but can't?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe explicit about boundary choices and their consequences.\nEvery boundary is a choice \u2014 make those choices visible and contestable.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing boundary analyses from multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. COMPARE BOUNDARY CHOICES\n- Do different sources draw boundaries differently?\n- What's included in one source but excluded in another?\n- What do boundary differences reveal about perspectives?\n\n### 2. AGGREGATE EXTERNALITIES\n- What externalities appear across sources?\n- Are some externalities consistently ignored?\n- Who consistently bears external costs?\n\n### 3. MAP BOUNDARY POLITICS\n- Whose framing dominates across sources?\n- What alternative boundaries are never considered?\n- What does the pattern of boundaries reveal?\n\n### 4. SYNTHESIZE ALTERNATIVES\n- What boundary alternatives emerge from multi-source analysis?\n- Which alternatives would address the most externalities?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate a boundary analysis that makes visible the choices that sources\noften take for granted.\n",
