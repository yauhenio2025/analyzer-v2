Rate the TENSION LEVEL (0-1):\n   - 1.0 = irreconcilable opposition\n   - 0.5 = significant disagreement with potential resolution\n   - 0.0 = superficial disagreement already resolved\n\n## BINARY OPPOSITIONS\nIdentify key conceptual binaries structuring the text:\n- nature/culture, public/private, regulation/innovation, etc.\n- Which term is privileged (treated as default/superior)?\n- What structural role does the binary play?\n\n## UNRESOLVED CONTRADICTIONS\nFind logical inconsistencies or tensions:\n- Where does the author contradict themselves?\n- Where do cited sources conflict?\n- What remains unaddressed?\n\n## DIALECTICAL MOVEMENT\nHow does the argument develop dialectically?\n- What triggers shifts in position?\n- What's the overall trajectory?\n\n\nExtract comprehensively - capture all dialectical dynamics in the text.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing dialectical analyses from multiple articles into a unified dialectical map.\n\nYour task:\n1. **IDENTIFY RECURRING PAIRS**: Find thesis/antithesis pairs that appear across articles\n   - Same opposition expressed differently = merge\n   - Track which articles address which tensions\n\n2. **TRACK SYNTHESIS ATTEMPTS**:\n   - Which tensions get resolved across the collection?\n   - What resolution strategies are proposed?\n   - Which remain intractable?\n\n3. **MAP BINARY OPPOSITIONS**:\n   - Which binaries structure the entire discourse?\n   - How consistently is each term privileged?\n   - Are any binaries deconstructed or inverted?\n\n4. **IDENTIFY META-CONTRADICTIONS**:\n   - Do articles contradict each other?\n   - What systemic tensions emerge at the collection level?\n\n5. **CHART DIALECTICAL PROGRESSION**:\n   - If articles have temporal ordering, how does the debate evolve?\n   - What triggers position shifts?\n   - What's the current state of the discourse?\n\nCreate clear, descriptive pair_ids (e.g., \"innovation_vs_regulation\").\n\n\nOutput a comprehensive dialectical map of the collection.\n",
  "concretization_prompt": "\nTransform the dialectical map to use concrete, recognizable labels:\n\n1. Convert pair_ids to descriptive names:\n   - \"D1\" \u2192 \"The Innovation-Regulation Tension\"\n   - \"D2\" \u2192 \"The Speed-Safety Tradeoff\"\n\n2. Name binary oppositions clearly:\n   - Include concrete examples from the text\n\n3. Label contradictions specifically:\n   - \"C1\" \u2192 \"The Efficiency-Equity Paradox\"\n\n4. Make proponents and positions concrete:\n   - Replace generic labels with actual names/organizations\n\nPreserve all structural relationships, tension levels, and resolution statuses.\nMake the output immediately understandable to a researcher.\n",
