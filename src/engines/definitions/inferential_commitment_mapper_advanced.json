  "extraction_prompt": "\n\n## THE BRANDOMIAN FRAMEWORK: A DEEP PRIMER\n\nYou are about to perform analysis using Robert Brandom's inferentialist framework.\nThis is NOT a superficial keyword exercise. You need to understand the DEPTH of\nthis approach to do it justice.\n\n### 1. THE CORE INSIGHT: MEANING IS INFERENTIAL ROLE\n\nForget the picture theory of meaning (words as labels for things). Brandom's\nradical claim: **to understand a concept is to master its inferential role**.\n\nWhat does this mean practically?\n- You understand \"dog\" not by pointing at dogs, but by knowing:\n  - What FOLLOWS from something being a dog (it's an animal, it can bark, etc.)\n  - What would ENTITLE you to call something a dog (four legs, fur, barks, etc.)\n  - What's INCOMPATIBLE with being a dog (being a cat, being inanimate, etc.)\n\nThis is why we analyze INFERENTIAL COMMITMENTS - they ARE the meaning.\n\n### 2. THE GAME OF GIVING AND ASKING FOR REASONS\n\nDiscourse isn't information transfer. It's a NORMATIVE PRACTICE.\n\nWhen someone asserts something, they're not just making sounds - they're:\n- **Undertaking a commitment** (putting themselves on the hook)\n- **Claiming entitlement** (implying they have the right to say this)\n- **Changing the score** (altering what others can demand of them)\n\nEvery conversation is a game where we:\n- Challenge each other: \"Why do you think that?\"\n- Hold each other accountable: \"But you also said X, which contradicts this\"\n- Grant and withdraw authority: \"Given your expertise, I'll take your word\"\n\n### 3. COMMITMENT VS. ENTITLEMENT: THE CRUCIAL DISTINCTION\n\nThese are DEONTIC STATUSES - normative standings, not psychological states.\n\n**COMMITMENT**: What you're HELD TO, not what you believe.\n- If you assert P, you're committed to P regardless of your private doubts\n- You inherit DOWNSTREAM commitments (if P implies Q, you're committed to Q)\n- Others can HOLD you to these commitments\n- You can be committed to things you don't realize you're committed to\n\n**ENTITLEMENT**: Your AUTHORITY to make a claim.\n- Having reasons that would justify the claim if challenged\n- Inheriting entitlement from other entitled claims\n- Testimony: borrowing entitlement from others' authority\n- Default entitlement: claims presumed okay unless challenged\n\nTHE ASYMMETRY IS CRUCIAL:\n- You can be COMMITTED without being ENTITLED (making a claim you shouldn't)\n- You can be ENTITLED without being COMMITTED (having the right but not exercising it)\n- Discourse polices this gap: \"You have no right to say that!\"\n\n### 4. MATERIAL INFERENCE: CONTENT, NOT JUST FORM\n\nFormal logic: \"All A are B; X is A; therefore X is B\" - valid by FORM.\n\nMaterial inference: \"It's raining \u2192 the streets will be wet\" - valid by CONTENT.\n\nBrandom (following Sellars): Material inferences are PRIMARY. They're what give\nconcepts their content. \"Rain\" and \"wet streets\" are connected not by logic\nbut by how the world works and how we use these concepts.\n\nWhen analyzing text, look for:\n- What CONTENT-BASED inferences are treated as valid?\n- What domain makes these inferences good?\n- What would DEFEAT them (counterexamples, unusual circumstances)?\n\n### 5. INCOMPATIBILITY: MORE FUNDAMENTAL THAN ENTAILMENT\n\nBrandom's radical claim: **incompatibility is more basic than implication**.\n\nYou understand \"red\" primarily by knowing it EXCLUDES \"green\" (at the same spot),\nnot by knowing what it implies. The space of reasons is carved up by what\nCAN'T be held together.\n\nTypes of incompatibility:\n- **Logical**: Formal contradiction (P and not-P)\n- **Material**: Can't both be true given how concepts work (\"The ball is red all over\" vs \"The ball is blue all over\")\n- **Practical**: Can't act on both (\"Go left\" vs \"Go right\")\n- **Normative**: Can't consistently endorse both positions\n\n### 6. SCOREKEEPING: THE SOCIAL-PERSPECTIVAL DIMENSION\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: **different people keep different scores**.\n\nWhen you assert something:\n- YOU update your own commitments and entitlements\n- OTHERS update what they ATTRIBUTE to you (which may differ!)\n- The game involves tracking these multiple perspectives\n\nThis means:\n- What you think you're committed to \u2260 what others hold you to\n- Disputes often involve disagreement about the score itself\n- Authority is perspectivally distributed\n\n### 7. DEFAULT VS. EARNED ENTITLEMENT\n\nNot all claims carry equal burden. This is crucial for analysis:\n\n**DEFAULT ENTITLEMENT**: Claims you can make unless challenged.\n- Some things are just assumed okay until someone objects\n- \"Technology shapes experience\" - most would nod along\n- These reveal the SHARED ASSUMPTIONS of a discourse community\n- Question: Who could challenge this and be taken seriously?\n\n**EARNED ENTITLEMENT**: Claims requiring upfront justification.\n- Some things you have to PROVE before anyone will accept them\n- \"Postphenomenology supersedes Heidegger\" - controversial, needs backing\n- These reveal where the author is STICKING THEIR NECK OUT\n- Question: What would count as sufficient proof?\n\n**THE ANALYTICAL PAYOFF**: Claims with default entitlement show power structures.\nWhat \"goes without saying\" reveals what the discourse community takes for granted.\nClaims requiring earned entitlement show where real argumentative work happens.\n\n### 8. THE PERSPECTIVAL GAP: WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE SAYING VS. WHAT OTHERS HEAR\n\nBrandom's scorekeeping is PERSPECTIVAL. Different parties track different scores.\n\n**WHAT THE AUTHOR UNDERTAKES** - commitments they'd acknowledge:\n- \"Yes, I'm claiming technologies mediate experience\"\n- These are the OFFICIAL positions\n\n**WHAT READERS MIGHT ATTRIBUTE** - commitments they'll be held to:\n- \"So you're saying there's no authentic human nature?\"\n- These are the IMPLICATIONS others will draw\n\nThe most interesting findings: Where authors would be SURPRISED by what their\nposition commits them to. The \"wait, I didn't mean THAT\" moments.\n\n**THE ANALYTICAL PAYOFF**: Map both what authors THINK they're committing to\nAND what careful readers would hold them to. The gap is revelatory.\n\n### 9. EXPRESSIVE VOCABULARY: WHERE THEY SHOW THEIR WORK\n\nBrandom's insight: Words like \"therefore,\" \"because,\" \"however,\" \"but\" don't\nadd content - they make VISIBLE the inferential moves that were already implicit.\n\n**SHOWING THEIR WORK**: \"X, therefore Y\"\n- The author EXPLICITLY displays the inference\n- They're inviting challenge to the connection itself\n- This is where they feel CONFIDENT\n\n**SNEAKING IT IN**: \"X. Y follows naturally...\"\n- The inference is BURIED, presented as obvious\n- Not opened for inspection\n- Often the WEAKEST links are hidden this way\n\n**USING \"BUT\" OR \"HOWEVER\"**: These flag incompatibilities the author acknowledges\n- Valuable map of their own sense of tensions\n- Shows where they see trade-offs\n\n**THE ANALYTICAL PAYOFF**: Hidden inferences are often vulnerable. Explicit ones\nare where the author feels confident. This reveals actual argumentative structure.\n\n### 10. THE CITATION BAGGAGE PROBLEM\n\nWhen you endorse or cite someone, you're not just taking one idea - you're\ninheriting a PACKAGE. But people try to cherry-pick.\n\nFor each major citation/endorsement:\n- **WHAT THEY WANT**: The specific claim or insight they're borrowing\n- **WHAT COMES WITH IT**: The other commitments that position carries\n- **WHAT THEY TRY TO LEAVE BEHIND**: The implications they dodge\n- **CAN YOU ACTUALLY DO THAT?**: Is the cherry-picking coherent?\n\nExample: If you cite Heidegger on technology's revealing character, do you\nalso buy his critique of modern technology as enframing? Can you take the\ninsight without the cultural pessimism?\n\n**THE ANALYTICAL PAYOFF**: Reveals whether intellectual debts are being\nhonestly acknowledged or selectively exploited.\n\n### 11. PERFORMATIVE CONTRADICTIONS: DOES THE WALK MATCH THE TALK?\n\nBeyond logical and material incompatibility, look for where the author's\nPRACTICE contradicts their CLAIMS:\n\n**SELF-REFUTING MOVES**:\n- Claiming \"universal claims about Technology are impossible\" IS a universal claim\n- Arguing \"all knowledge is situated\" from a position claiming to see the whole picture\n- Insisting \"we can only analyze case-by-case\" while drawing general conclusions\n\n**THE PRAGMATIC TEST**: Does how they argue fit with what they're arguing?\n- If they claim empirical grounding, is the argument actually empirical?\n- If they reject grand narratives, do they sneak in a grand narrative?\n\n**THE ANALYTICAL PAYOFF**: Performative contradictions are devastating findings.\nThey show the position undermines itself.\n\n### 12. THE AUTHORITY LANDSCAPE: WHO GETS TO JUST ASSERT?\n\nEntitlement isn't just about having good reasons - it's about SOCIAL STANDING.\nDifferent speakers get different levels of default credibility.\n\n**HIGH DEFAULT ENTITLEMENT** (can just assert):\n- The field's founders and canonical figures\n- Claims aligned with institutional consensus\n- Methodologically \"safe\" positions\n\n**LOW DEFAULT ENTITLEMENT** (must prove credentials):\n- Newcomers challenging orthodoxy\n- Interdisciplinary interlopers\n- Claims that threaten institutional interests\n\n**THE ASYMMETRY MATTERS**: The same claim from a senior figure vs. a graduate\nstudent faces different entitlement demands. This isn't fair, but it's real,\nand it shapes what gets taken seriously.\n\n**THE ANALYTICAL PAYOFF**: Reveals the power structures in intellectual discourse.\n\n### 13. ARE THEY EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING?\n\nBefore mapping disagreement, check: do disputants share meanings?\n\n**VERBAL DISAGREEMENT**: Same word, different concepts\n- Author A: \"mediation\" means X, implies Y\n- Author B: \"mediation\" means X', implies Y'\n- They SEEM to disagree but actually have different topics\n\n**VERBAL AGREEMENT**: Different words, same concept\n- They seem to be different positions but actually agree\n\n**THE TEST**: What would each party accept as EVIDENCE for or against their\nclaims? If they'd accept different evidence, they may be talking about\ndifferent things despite using the same vocabulary.\n\n**THE ANALYTICAL PAYOFF**: Often reveals that debates are talking past each\nother, which is crucial for understanding why they can't be resolved.\n\n### 14. THE STRENGTH OF THE HOOK: MUST, MAY, OR USUALLY?\n\nNot all implications bind equally. Classify each:\n\n**IRON-CLAD (\"Must\")**: If you accept A, you HAVE TO accept B. No wiggle room.\n- Test: Would denying B while affirming A be outright contradictory?\n\n**STRONG DEFAULT (\"Usually\")**: Normally committed to B unless special reason.\n- Test: Could you coherently say \"Yes A, but not B because [specific reason]\"?\n\n**PERMISSIVE (\"May\")**: A opens up the POSSIBILITY of B without forcing it.\n- Test: Does A enable B without requiring it?\n\n**CONTESTED**: Whether A implies B is itself the dispute.\n- Test: Do competent users of these concepts disagree about the connection?\n\n**THE ANALYTICAL PAYOFF**: Focus energy on \"Usually\" - that's where there's\nactual argumentative play. \"Must\" is locked in; \"May\" is optional.\n\n### 15. THE OPEN HORIZON: WHAT MIGHT THIS TURN OUT TO MEAN?\n\nBrandom's deep insight: the content of concepts isn't fully determined in\nadvance. Future developments can reveal what we were \"really\" committed to.\n\n**WHAT MIGHT THIS TURN OUT TO MEAN?**\n- What future discoveries could change what this commits us to?\n- What's the not-yet-determined content that remains open?\n- Where might proponents be surprised by where this leads?\n\n**RETROACTIVE VINDICATION**:\n- Could this position turn out to be RIGHT in ways not currently appreciated?\n- Could it turn out to be WRONG in ways the author can't see?\n\n**THE ANALYTICAL PAYOFF**: Reveals the LIVE potential of ideas, not just\ntheir current state. Speculative but powerful.\n\n### WHY THIS MATTERS FOR ANALYSIS\n\nWhen you analyze a text through this lens, you're revealing:\n- The HIDDEN STRUCTURE of what's being taken for granted\n- The NORMATIVE FORCE that propagates through the discourse\n- What readers are being INVITED TO COMMIT TO (often without realizing)\n- Where the PRESSURE POINTS are (incompatibilities that create tension)\n- What DISCURSIVE MOVES are available and what they cost\n- The POWER STRUCTURES shaping who can say what\n- The PERSPECTIVAL GAPS between authorial intention and reader attribution\n- The PERFORMATIVE TENSIONS where practice contradicts position\n\nThis is powerful because it exposes the BINDING FORCE of language that\nreaders often experience without understanding.\n\n---\n\nNOW: Apply this framework with full sophistication internally, but your\nOUTPUT will be translated into accessible language for non-philosophers.\nThe analysis should be Brandomian; the presentation should be clear.\n\n\n---\n\n## YOUR EXTRACTION TASK\n\nNow apply this framework to analyze the document. Remember: analyze with\nfull Brandomian sophistication, but frame your outputs accessibly.\n\n### STEP 1: READ CAREFULLY FIRST\n\nBefore extracting anything:\n1. **Who is the author?** What's their stance?\n2. **Is this a CRITIQUE or ENDORSEMENT** of the ideas discussed?\n3. **What's the ACTUAL ARGUMENT**, not just the vocabulary used?\n\nDO NOT hallucinate based on keywords. Analyze what the author ACTUALLY argues.\n\n### STEP 2: IDENTIFY KEY IDEAS (AS PROPER CONCEPTS)\n\n**CRITICAL NAMING CONVENTION**: Name concepts as CONCEPTUAL TERMS (noun phrases),\nNOT as propositional claims or sentences.\n\n**BAD names** (claims/sentences):\n- \"Algorithms Cannot Decide Everything\"\n- \"Knowledge Cannot Be Centralized\"\n- \"Markets Coordinate Through Prices\"\n\n**GOOD names** (conceptual terms/noun phrases):\n- \"Algorithmic Undecidability\"\n- \"Knowledge Dispersion\" or \"Epistemic Limitation\"\n- \"Price Coordination\" or \"Market Signaling\"\n\nThe **what_it_means** field should contain the propositional content:\n- Name: \"Algorithmic Undecidability\"\n- what_it_means: \"The thesis that algorithms cannot decide everything - there are inherent limits to computational decision-making.\"\n\nFor each significant concept in the document:\n- Give it a PROPER CONCEPTUAL NAME (2-4 word noun phrase, can use technical terms)\n- Put the propositional claim/meaning in the what_it_means field\n- How CENTRAL is it to the argument? (Core ideas vs. peripheral mentions)\n- What ROLE does it play? (Premise? Conclusion? Assumption?)\n\n### STEP 3: MAP WHAT YOU'RE SIGNING UP FOR\n\nThis is the heart of Brandomian analysis. For each key idea:\n\n**Apply the commitment test**: If someone endorses this idea, what ELSE are\nthey committing to, whether they realize it or not?\n\nLook for:\n- **Immediate implications**: What directly follows?\n- **Downstream effects**: What follows from THOSE?\n- **Hidden passengers**: What comes along for the ride that people don't notice?\n- **Practical consequences**: What would you have to DO if you believed this?\n\nRate each: Is this connection TIGHT (you're locked in), USUAL (normally follows),\nor LOOSE (suggested but escapable)?\n\nFlag: Would most people REALIZE this connection? Hidden commitments are gold.\n\n### STEP 4: MAP WHAT BACKS THINGS UP\n\nFor each claim, ask: **What gives anyone the RIGHT to say this?**\n\nSources of backing:\n- **Reasoning**: It follows from other things we accept\n- **Expert say-so**: Someone authoritative vouches for it\n- **Observation**: We can just see it's true\n- **Just assumed**: It's treated as obvious without argument\n\nThen ask: **What would UNDERMINE this backing?**\n- What evidence would defeat it?\n- What counterexamples would break it?\n- Whose challenge would be hard to answer?\n\n### STEP 5: FIND THE EITHER/OR CHOICES\n\nThis is where Brandom shines. Look for INCOMPATIBILITIES:\n\n**Where you can't have it both ways:**\n- Positions that logically contradict\n- Ideas that work against each other in practice\n- Values that pull in opposite directions\n- Frameworks that see the world differently\n\nFor each either/or:\n- How STARK is the choice? (Absolute vs. soft)\n- How do people TRY to escape the choice? (Common fudges and compromises)\n- What's at STAKE in choosing?\n\n### STEP 6: TRACE REAL-WORLD IMPLICATIONS\n\nMaterial inferences - what follows in PRACTICE, not just logic:\n\n- \"If you believe X, then in the real world, Y follows\"\n- \"Accepting this framework means treating people/things as...\"\n- \"This position commits you to supporting/opposing...\"\n\nNote what DOMAIN makes these inferences valid, and what EXCEPTIONS exist.\n\n### STEP 7: TRACK HOW THE CONVERSATION SHIFTS\n\nWhen someone makes a claim, the discursive landscape changes:\n\n- **They put themselves on the hook for**: What can others now challenge them on?\n- **They gain standing to**: What can they now say that they couldn't before?\n- **They lose ability to**: What positions are now closed off to them?\n- **Others can now demand**: What explanations/justifications are now owed?\n\nThis reveals the STAKES of making claims - the normative cost.\n\n### STEP 8: IDENTIFY PACKAGE DEALS\n\nIdeas often come bundled. Look for:\n\n- **Belief clusters**: Ideas that tend to come together\n- **Ideological packages**: Named positions (like \"classical liberalism\" or \"social constructionism\")\n- **Hidden bundles**: Commitments that secretly come as packages\n\nFor each package:\n- What's in the CORE (definitional)?\n- What COMES ALONG (associated but not required)?\n- What packages are INCOMPATIBLE?\n\n### STEP 9: SURFACE TENSIONS\n\nFind where the discourse is UNSTABLE:\n\n- Commitments that pull against each other\n- Either/or choices being fudged\n- Implications being ignored\n- Authority sources in conflict\n\nRate each tension: Stable standoff? Active conflict? Unacknowledged?\n\n### STEP 10: MAP THE ENTITLEMENT LANDSCAPE\n\nNot all claims are created equal. Sort them:\n\n**Default Entitlements** (assumed okay unless challenged):\n- What does the author just ASSERT without feeling need to defend?\n- What's treated as obvious common ground?\n- What's \"everyone knows\" territory?\n\n**Earned Entitlements** (requiring proof):\n- What does the author actually ARGUE for?\n- What would cause raised eyebrows if stated without backing?\n- What claims would opponents immediately challenge?\n\nThis reveals the INVISIBLE BACKGROUND of shared assumptions - and shows what\nwould happen if someone challenged those \"obvious\" starting points.\n\n### STEP 11: FIND THE PERSPECTIVAL GAPS\n\nWhere might speakers and hearers be missing each other?\n\n**Look for:**\n- Ambiguous terms that different audiences read differently\n- Claims that sound neutral but carry hidden partisan charge\n- Technical terms used in everyday-sounding ways (or vice versa)\n- Context-dependent claims stated without context\n\n**For each gap:**\n- What does the speaker think they're saying?\n- What might typical audiences hear?\n- What goes wrong because of the gap?\n- What would close it?\n\nThis is Brandom's perspectival structure applied to communication analysis.\n\n### STEP 12: TRACK EXPRESSIVE VOCABULARY\n\nFind where authors SHOW THEIR INFERENTIAL WORK with connective words:\n\n**Power words to track:**\n- \"therefore,\" \"thus,\" \"hence,\" \"so\" (claiming consequence)\n- \"but,\" \"however,\" \"yet,\" \"although\" (acknowledging tension)\n- \"because,\" \"since,\" \"given that\" (providing grounds)\n- \"must,\" \"necessarily,\" \"inevitably\" (claiming iron-clad connection)\n- \"merely,\" \"just,\" \"simply\" (minimizing)\n\n**For each occurrence:**\n- What inferential work is being claimed?\n- Is the claim EARNED by the content?\n- Where do \"therefore\"s overreach? Where do \"but\"s smuggle exemptions?\n\n### STEP 13: AUDIT CITATION BAGGAGE\n\nWhen authors cite or endorse others, they inherit commitments.\n\n**Look for:**\n- Who is being cited approvingly?\n- What ELSE does that cited source believe?\n- Does the citing author realize the full package they're endorsing?\n- What embarrassing fellow-travelers come along?\n\nThis often reveals hidden theoretical alliances and unexpected commitments.\n\n### STEP 14: SPOT PERFORMATIVE CONTRADICTIONS\n\nWhere does PRACTICE contradict POSITION?\n\n**Look for:**\n- Claims about objectivity made from obvious standpoints\n- Critiques of rhetoric using heavy rhetoric\n- Assertions of humility made with great confidence\n- Denials of authority made authoritatively\n- Claims that truth doesn't matter made as if they matter\n\nThese reveal the GAP between what's being said and what's being done.\n\n### STEP 15: MAP THE AUTHORITY LANDSCAPE\n\nWho gets believed without proof? Who has to defend everything?\n\n**Document:**\n- Whose word is treated as sufficient?\n- What TYPES of authority are at play? (Expert? Institutional? Moral?)\n- Who is granted default entitlement?\n- Who is forced into earned entitlement territory?\n- What power dynamics does this reveal?\n\n### STEP 16: TEST \"SAME WORD, SAME THING?\"\n\nFind where people use the SAME WORDS but mean DIFFERENT THINGS:\n\n**Look for:**\n- Key terms used by multiple speakers/in multiple contexts\n- Evidence that definitions differ despite shared vocabulary\n- Conversations that are PSEUDO-debates (just talking past each other)\n- Cases where \"disagreement\" is actually about language, not substance\n\nThis exposes where CONCEPTUAL TRANSLATION is needed versus genuine clash.\n\n### STEP 17: CLASSIFY MODAL STRENGTH\n\nHow tight are the claimed connections?\n\n**Sort claims by strength:**\n- **MUST** (Iron-clad): \"X necessarily implies Y\"\n- **USUALLY** (Defeasible): \"X normally leads to Y, with exceptions\"\n- **MAY** (Permissive): \"X is compatible with Y\"\n\n**Then evaluate:**\n- Is the claimed strength EARNED?\n- Where are \"usually\"s dressed up as \"must\"s?\n- What counterexamples would break the claim?\n- What's the cost of overstatement?\n\n### STEP 18: IDENTIFY OPEN HORIZONS\n\nFind claims that AWAIT FUTURE VINDICATION:\n\n**Look for:**\n- Predictions that time will tell about\n- Historical analogies awaiting confirmation\n- Bets on how things will turn out\n- Claims that \"history will show...\"\n\n**Assess:**\n- What would VINDICATE the position?\n- What would DEFEAT it?\n- Does the author hedge appropriately?\n- What's the time horizon (years, decades, generations)?\n\nThis reveals where authors are playing THE LONG GAME versus making testable claims.\n\n### STEP 19: BUILD THE RELATIONSHIP GRAPH (V2 - CRITICAL)\n\nThis is the most important step for enabling powerful pattern detection and visualization.\n\n**For EVERY entity you extract, you MUST also identify its connections.**\n\n#### 19A: CROSS-REFERENCE EVERY ENTITY\n\n**FOR EACH COMMITMENT (C{N}):**\n- What idea(s) generate this commitment? \u2192 source_idea (I{N})\n- What backing(s) support it? \u2192 backed_by (B{N})\n- What other commitments conflict with it? \u2192 conflicts_with (C{N})\n- What downstream commitments does accepting this lead to? \u2192 leads_to (C{N})\n- Which either/or choices does this relate to? \u2192 related_choices (X{N})\n- What practical implications flow from it? \u2192 practical_implications (IMP{N})\n\n**FOR EACH BACKING (B{N}):**\n- What does this backing support? \u2192 supports_claims (C{N}, I{N})\n- Does it depend on other backings? \u2192 depends_on_backings (B{N})\n- Does it come from a citation? \u2192 from_citation (CIT{N})\n- What would contest it? \u2192 contested_by (B{N})\n\n**FOR EACH IDEA (I{N}):**\n- What backings support this idea? \u2192 supported_by_backings (B{N})\n- What commitments flow from accepting this? \u2192 generates_commitments (C{N})\n- What other ideas conflict with it? \u2192 conflicts_with_ideas (I{N})\n- Which packages include this? \u2192 part_of_packages (P{N})\n\n**FOR EACH CHOICE (X{N}):**\n- What commitments come with choosing A? \u2192 commitments_for_a (C{N})\n- What commitments come with choosing B? \u2192 commitments_for_b (C{N})\n- What ideas are at stake? \u2192 ideas_involved (I{N})\n- What tensions does this relate to? \u2192 related_tensions (T{N})\n\n#### 19B: BUILD EXPLICIT RELATIONSHIP GRAPH\n\nCreate a `relationship_graph` with:\n- **nodes**: Every entity becomes a node (idea, commitment, backing, choice, etc.)\n- **edges**: Every cross-reference becomes an edge with:\n  - relationship type (supports, conflicts, leads_to, generates, etc.)\n  - strength (1.0=locked_in, 0.7=usually, 0.4=loosely)\n  - direction (some are bidirectional)\n- **clusters**: Group tightly connected entities into named clusters\n\n#### 19C: IDENTIFY COMMITMENT CHAINS\n\nTrace SEQUENCES where accepting one commitment forces the next:\n\nExample: \"If you accept C1 (Marx's paradigm), you must accept C2 (practical perspective),\nwhich leads to C3 (socialism as condition), which leads to C4 (abolition of value form)...\"\n\nFor each chain, identify:\n- The starting point (what initiates it)\n- The sequence of commitments (in order)\n- The weakest link (lowest confidence step)\n- Where chains converge (multiple paths to same conclusion)\n- Where chains diverge (one commitment leads to multiple)\n- The total chain strength (product of link strengths)\n\n#### 19D: IDENTIFY BACKING HIERARCHIES\n\nFind where backings depend on other backings, forming a pyramid:\n- What's the ROOT backing (foundational claim everything rests on)?\n- What depends on it? What depends on THAT?\n- Is there a single point of failure?\n- What happens if the root is challenged?\n\n#### 19E: RELATIONSHIP STRENGTH MAPPING\n\nFor EVERY connection, assess strength:\n- **\"locked_in\" = 1.0**: Logical necessity - denying connection is contradictory\n- **\"usually\" = 0.7**: Strong default - holds unless special circumstances\n- **\"loosely\" = 0.4**: Defeasible connection - often holds but easily overridden\n\n**THE GOAL**: Extract a GRAPH, not just lists.

  "curation_prompt": "\n## SYNTHESIS TASK: CURATING ACROSS MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS\n\nYou have extracted inferential commitment analyses from multiple documents.\nNow synthesize them into a unified picture.\n\n\n## ANALYZING MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS AS A DISCOURSE\n\nWhen you have multiple documents, you're not just analyzing them separately -\nyou're mapping a CONVERSATION, a GAME OF GIVING AND ASKING FOR REASONS played\nacross texts, authors, and time.\n\n### THE DIALOGICAL DIMENSION\n\nBrandom's framework is fundamentally about DISCOURSE BETWEEN SPEAKERS.\nWith multiple documents, you can see this in action:\n\n#### 1. TRACING RESPONSES ACROSS TEXTS\n\nLook for where one author RESPONDS to another (implicitly or explicitly):\n- Does Author B accept commitments that Author A took on?\n- Does Author B challenge Author A's entitlements?\n- Does Author B try to hold Author A to implications they avoided?\n\nThis is scorekeeping across texts: \"You said X, which commits you to Y\"\n\n#### 2. MAPPING THE DISCURSIVE LANDSCAPE\n\nAcross all documents:\n- What are the SHARED commitments everyone seems to accept?\n- What are the CONTESTED claims where authors diverge?\n- What's being ASSUMED without argument (the common ground)?\n- What's being FOUGHT over (the active disputes)?\n\n#### 3. TRACKING COMMITMENT INHERITANCE\n\nWhen Author B cites or endorses Author A:\n- What commitments is B inheriting?\n- Does B realize all the downstream implications?\n- Is B cherry-picking (taking some commitments, dodging others)?\n\nThis reveals the NETWORK of who-commits-to-what across the conversation.\n\n#### 4. FINDING CROSS-TEXT INCOMPATIBILITIES\n\nThe most powerful analysis: find where authors hold INCOMPATIBLE positions\nwithout acknowledging it:\n- Author A says X, Author B says Y, but X and Y can't both be true\n- This reveals the FAULT LINES in the discourse\n- Shows where the field will eventually have to choose\n\n#### 5. TRACING AUTHORITY FLOWS\n\nAcross documents:\n- Who is being CITED as authority? (Borrowed entitlement)\n- Who is being CHALLENGED? (Entitlement denial)\n- What's the CHAIN of authority? (A trusts B trusts C...)\n- Where are there CIRCULAR authority loops?\n\n#### 6. MAPPING PACKAGE EVOLUTION\n\nIdeas come in bundles, but bundles evolve:\n- How do ideological packages CHANGE across documents?\n- What new combinations are being tried?\n- What old bundles are being split apart?\n\n### SPECIAL COLLECTION OUTPUTS\n\nWhen synthesizing, create:\n\n1. **AUTHOR COMMITMENT MAP**: Who is committed to what?\n   - Author A: [commitment list]\n   - Author B: [commitment list]\n   - Shared: [commitments everyone holds]\n   - Contested: [commitments under dispute]\n\n2. **RESPONSE NETWORK**: Who responds to whom?\n   - B challenges A on X\n   - C supports B's challenge\n   - D tries to reconcile A and B\n\n3. **EVOLUTION TIMELINE**: How positions shift across texts\n   - Early consensus: X\n   - Challenge emerged: Y introduced\n   - Current state: X vs Y unresolved\n\n4. **FAULT LINE MAP**: The fundamental disagreements\n   - Fault line 1: Description\n   - Camp A: [Authors, positions]\n   - Camp B: [Authors, positions]\n   - What's at stake\n\n\n### THE BRANDOMIAN SYNTHESIS APPROACH\n\nRemember: you're not just merging lists. You're building a MAP of the\nnormative landscape - how ideas connect, conflict, and create pressure.\n\n### STEP 1: MERGE THE IDEA INVENTORY\n\n- Same idea appearing in multiple docs? Consolidate with richer understanding\n- Note when different authors treat the same idea differently\n- Build a unified vocabulary (pick the clearest names)\n\n### STEP 2: BUILD THE COMMITMENT NETWORK\n\nThis is where synthesis gets powerful:\n\n- **Commitment chains**: A commits to B commits to C\n  - Trace how far the chain goes\n  - Find the ultimate implications people don't see\n\n- **Commitment hubs**: Ideas that MANY things commit you to\n  - These are load-bearing concepts\n  - Attacking them has cascading effects\n\n- **Highly committing ideas**: Ideas that lock you into MANY things\n  - These are heavy lifts - accepting them is a big deal\n  - People should know what they're getting into\n\n### STEP 3: MAP THE BACKING STRUCTURE\n\n- Where does AUTHORITY ultimately come from in this discourse?\n- Find the GROUND LEVEL - claims treated as not needing backing\n- Find claims with SHAKY backing - vulnerable to challenge\n- Find BORROWED authority - who's vouching for whom?\n\n### STEP 4: BUILD THE EITHER/OR LANDSCAPE\n\nThis is crucial: What are the fundamental CHOICES in this space?\n\n- **Fault lines**: Where the discourse SPLITS into camps\n- **Fork points**: Where you have to choose a path\n- **Camp compatibility**: What other positions go with what?\n\nLook for:\n- Either/ors that DEFINE the debate\n- Either/ors that are being FUDGED\n- Either/ors that people DON'T REALIZE they're making\n\n### STEP 5: SYNTHESIZE REAL-WORLD IMPLICATIONS\n\n- Which implications appear across multiple documents?\n- Where do authors DISAGREE about implications?\n- What implications are being IGNORED or SUPPRESSED?\n\n### STEP 6: IDENTIFY DISCURSIVE PATTERNS\n\n- What MOVES are common in this discourse?\n- What do those moves COST (commitments incurred)?\n- What moves are HIGH-STAKES?\n\n### STEP 7: MAP PACKAGE DEALS\n\n- What ideological PACKAGES exist in this space?\n- Which packages are COMPATIBLE/INCOMPATIBLE?\n- Are there surprising package overlaps?\n\n### STEP 8: SURFACE FIELD-LEVEL TENSIONS\n\n- Where is the WHOLE DISCOURSE unstable?\n- What are the BIG unresolved questions?\n- What either/ors is the field avoiding?\n\n\n---\n\n\n## AUDIENCE-SPECIFIC LANGUAGE GUIDANCE\n\nYour output language MUST be calibrated to the target audience.

Purpose: Shows long-game claims awaiting history's verdict\n\n### TABLE LANGUAGE RULES\n\n- Column headers should be QUESTIONS or PLAIN PHRASES\n  - GOOD: \"What You Get\", \"The Catch\", \"Who Says So\"\n  - BAD: \"Commitment\", \"Entitlement\", \"Material Inference\"\n\n- Cell content should be PUNCHY and SCANNABLE\n  - GOOD: \"You're stuck defending AI autonomy\"\n  - BAD: \"This position entails downstream commitment to...\"\n\n- Use STATUS INDICATORS that feel natural:\n  - GOOD: \"Locked in\", \"Usually\", \"Loosely\"\n  - BAD: \"Necessary\", \"Defeasible\", \"Prima facie\"\n\n- For Yes/No columns, make it DRAMATIC:\n  - GOOD: \"\u2713 Signed up\", \"\u2717 Can't say\", \"\u26a0\ufe0f Risky\"\n  - BAD: \"True\", \"False\", \"Uncertain\"\n\n### TABLE STRUCTURE PRINCIPLES\n\n1. **Most important column first** - what grabs attention\n2. **3-6 columns max** - don't overwhelm\n3. **Rows should be scannable** - key info visible at a glance\n4. **Evocative names for row identifiers** - \"The AI Trust Choice\" not \"X1\"\n\n### WHEN TO USE WHICH TABLE\n\n- **Commitment Cascade**: When hidden implications are the key insight\n- **Either/Or**: When fundamental choices need to be highlighted\n- **Backing**: When authority/evidence structure matters\n- **Package Deals**: When comparing worldviews/ideologies\n- **Scorecard**: When showing impact of a specific move\n- **Author Comparison**: When synthesizing multiple documents\n- **Entitlement Audit**: When exposing hidden assumptions and privileged claims\n- **Perspectival Gap**: When showing communication failures across audiences\n- **Performative Contradiction**: When highlighting walk-vs-talk inconsistencies\n- **Authority Landscape**: When power dynamics of knowledge matter\n- **Same Word Different Meaning**: When pseudo-debates need exposing\n- **Modal Strength**: When claims overreach their evidence\n- **Open Horizons**: When tracking long-game predictions\n\n\n---\n\n\n## GUIDANCE FOR VISUAL OUTPUTS\n\nWhen your analysis will be rendered visually (network graphs, diagrams, etc.),\nstructure the data to support clear, impactful visuals.\n\n### KEY VISUAL PATTERNS\n\n1. **INVERTED PYRAMID** (for commitment cascades)\n   - Surface claim at top (small)\n   - Immediate implications (medium)\n   - Deep implications (large)\n   - Shows \"hidden mass\" beneath surface claims\n\n2. **FAULT LINE** (for either/or choices)\n   - Two territories separated by a divide\n   - Each side has its allied concepts\n   - The gap shows what can't be bridged\n\n3. **RIVER TRIBUTARIES** (for backing/authority)\n   - Multiple sources flowing into claims\n   - Shows where support comes from\n   - Thin streams = weak backing\n\n4. **PACKAGE BOXES** (for ideological bundles)\n   - Side-by-side comparison boxes\n   - Shows what comes bundled\n   - X marks incompatible packages\n\n5. **ENTITLEMENT GRADIENT** (for default vs. earned claims)\n   - Horizontal spectrum from \"Free Pass\" to \"Prove It\"\n   - Claims positioned along spectrum\n   - Size shows how much is at stake\n   - Color coding: green (default) to red (contested)\n\n6. **SPEAKER-HEARER SPLIT** (for perspectival gaps)\n   - Two overlapping circles (Venn-like)\n   - Speaker's intention in one circle\n   - Audience perception in the other\n   - Overlap shows shared understanding\n   - Non-overlap shows the communication gap\n\n7. **WALK-TALK CONTRAST** (for performative contradictions)\n   - Two-panel comparison (speech bubble vs. action)\n   - Contradiction severity shown by gap size\n   - Could be comic-strip style or formal diagram\n   - \"Says\" on left, \"Does\" on right\n\n8. **AUTHORITY HIERARCHY** (for authority landscape)\n   - Vertical layers showing who has to prove what to whom\n   - Top = unquestioned authorities\n   - Bottom = everyone has to prove everything\n   - Lines show who challenges whom\n\n9. **BABEL TOWER** (for same-word-different-concept)\n   - Single word at top\n   - Branches down to different meanings\n   - Shows how apparent agreement masks real confusion\n   - Separate \"definition territories\" for each speaker\n\n10. **STRENGTH GAUGE** (for modal analysis)\n    - Meter/gauge for each claim\n    - Three zones: MUST, USUALLY, MAY\n    - Needle shows claimed strength\n    - Highlighted zone shows actual strength\n    - Mismatch shown as warning\n\n11. **TIME HORIZON LINE** (for open horizons)\n    - Timeline extending into future\n    - Claims positioned at their vindication points\n    - Branching paths show vindication vs. defeat scenarios\n    - Fog/uncertainty increases toward far future\n\n### DATA STRUCTURE FOR VISUALS\n\nEnsure your output includes:\n- **Node weights**: How central/important is each idea?\n- **Edge strengths**: How tight is each connection?\n- **Cluster membership**: Which package does each idea belong to?\n- **Polarity**: Which \"side\" is each idea on?\n\n### LABELING FOR VISUALS\n\nAll labels should be:\n- SHORT (2-5 words for nodes)\n- EVOCATIVE (capture the essence)\n- JARGON-FREE (no philosophical terms)\n\nExamples:\n- \"The AI Autonomy Bet\" not \"commitment_ai_1\"\n- \"You Can't Have Both\" not \"incompatibility_relation\"\n- \"Expert Say-So\" not \"testimonial_entitlement\"\n\n",
