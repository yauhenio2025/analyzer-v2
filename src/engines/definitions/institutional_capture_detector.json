  "description": "Detects institutional and regulatory capture. Identifies when regulators serve industry, institutions serve staff over mission, interest groups dominate, and personnel movement creates conflicts. Essential for understanding institutional failure.",

  "reasoning_domain": "institutional",
  "researcher_question": "Has this institution been captured by narrow interests?",
  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are detecting INSTITUTIONAL CAPTURE \u2014 when institutions meant to serve\nbroad interests are captured by narrow interests.\n\n## TYPES OF CAPTURE\n\n### REGULATORY CAPTURE\nRegulators serve the industry they regulate:\n- Industry writes the rules\n- Enforcement is weak against industry interests\n- Public interest subordinated to industry interest\n\n### MISSION DRIFT\nInstitution serves itself rather than mission:\n- Staff interests dominate\n- Bureaucratic growth over mission effectiveness\n- Self-preservation over purpose\n\n### INTEREST GROUP CAPTURE\nConcentrated interests dominate diffuse interests:\n- Small groups with strong interests vs. large groups with weak interests\n- Lobbying, funding, expertise capture\n- Regulatory outcomes favor organized interests\n\n### REVOLVING DOOR\nPersonnel movement creates conflicts:\n- Regulators move to industry (and back)\n- Creates incentives to please future employers\n- Industry expertise becomes industry loyalty\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY INSTITUTIONS\nWhat institutions are described?\n- What's the stated mission?\n- Who are supposed beneficiaries?\n- How does it actually operate?\n\n### STEP 2: LOOK FOR CAPTURE INDICATORS\nSigns of regulatory capture:\n- Rules that favor industry over public\n- Weak enforcement against industry\n- Industry personnel in regulatory positions\n\nSigns of mission drift:\n- Activities that don't serve mission\n- Resources going to institutional maintenance\n- Staff interests prioritized\n\nSigns of interest group capture:\n- Organized groups with outsized influence\n- Public interest groups marginalized\n- Regulatory outcomes consistently favor same groups\n\n### STEP 3: ANALYZE BENEFICIARIES\nWho actually benefits from institutional action?\n- Compare to who should benefit\n- Identify systematic beneficiary patterns\n- Who loses?\n\n### STEP 4: MAP REVOLVING DOOR\nWhat personnel movement occurs?\n- Industry to regulator?\n- Regulator to industry?\n- What capture does this create?\n\n### STEP 5: ASSESS CAPTURE LEVEL\nHow captured is the institution?\n- Fully captured: Serves narrow interests completely\n- Substantially captured: Mostly serves narrow interests\n- Partially captured: Split between interests\n- Contested: Active struggle for control\n- Independent: Serves stated mission\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about who benefits and how. \"Regulatory capture\" as a vague\nclaim is not useful. \"The agency consistently rules in favor of the three\nlargest firms, who employ former commissioners\" is useful.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing institutional capture analyses across multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. AGGREGATE CAPTURE EVIDENCE\n- What capture patterns appear across sources?\n- Which institutions show most capture?\n\n### 2. IDENTIFY SYSTEMIC PATTERNS\n- Is capture field-wide or institution-specific?\n- What mechanisms create capture?\n\n### 3. ASSESS COUNTER-CAPTURE\n- What resists capture?\n- How effective are counter-mechanisms?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive map of institutional capture and its mechanisms.\n",
