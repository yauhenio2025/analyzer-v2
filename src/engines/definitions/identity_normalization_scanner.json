  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in Ian Hacking's philosophy of interactive kinds, analyzing how concepts shape people.\n\nFor this article, perform an IDENTITY NORMALIZATION SCAN:\n\n## 1. CONCEPT IDENTIFICATION\nFor each significant concept:\n- **Term**: The concept name/phrase\n- **Definition**: How it's used\n- **Identity relevance**: Does it classify or describe kinds of people?\n\n## 2. SUBJECT POSITION ANALYSIS\nFor concepts that create kinds of people:\n- **What kind of person** does this concept create/describe?\n- **What traits** are associated with this kind?\n- **What behaviors** are expected?\n- **Is it positive, negative, or ambivalent?**\n- **When did this kind emerge?**\n- **Is the classification contested?**\n\n## 3. LOOPING EFFECT DETECTION\nWhere classifications interact with the classified:\n- **How do classified people respond** to being classified?\n- **Do they embrace, resist, or transform** the category?\n- **How do classifiers then adjust** their categories?\n- **Is this loop stable or evolving?**\n\n## 4. NORMALIZATION PRESSURE MAPPING\nIdentify what's being normalized or pathologized:\n- **What behaviors are normalized?** (Made to seem natural, expected)\n- **What behaviors are pathologized?** (Made to seem deviant, problematic)\n- **What mechanisms enforce this?** (Institutions, social pressure, self-discipline)\n- **What resistance is possible?**\n\n## 5. IDENTITY WORK ANALYSIS\nHow do individuals work with these categories:\n- **Do they embrace** the identity?\n- **Do they negotiate** its meaning?\n- **Do they resist** the classification?\n- **Do they subvert** it creatively?\n\n## 6. INSTITUTIONAL CLASSIFICATION MAPPING\nHow do institutions use these concepts:\n- **What classification schemes** deploy these concepts?\n- **What administrative functions** do they serve?\n- **What effects** do they have on classified populations?\n\n## 7. NORMAL/PATHOLOGICAL BOUNDARIES\nIdentify where lines are drawn:\n- **What's on the normal side?**\n- **What's on the pathological side?**\n- **How firm is the boundary?**\n- **Who enforces it?**\n\n\nThink about how concepts make up people and how people respond.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing identity normalization analyses from multiple articles.\n\nYour task:\n\n## 1. CONSOLIDATE CONCEPT INVENTORIES\n- Merge same concepts across articles\n- Collect all identity-relevant information\n- Rate identity relevance\n\n## 2. MAP SUBJECT POSITIONS\n- Aggregate all subject positions created\n- Identify overlapping/conflicting positions\n- Track historical emergence\n- Note contested classifications\n\n## 3. ANALYZE LOOPING EFFECTS\n- Identify loop patterns across articles\n- Categorize loop types (confirmation, resistance, transformation)\n- Assess loop stability\n- Track classification-response-revision dynamics\n\n## 4. SYNTHESIZE NORMALIZATION LANDSCAPE\n- Map what's normalized across the discourse\n- Map what's pathologized\n- Identify enforcement mechanisms\n- Note resistance possibilities and their limits\n\n## 5. AGGREGATE IDENTITY WORK PATTERNS\n- Identify how people work with categories\n- Map strategies and their outcomes\n- Note resources required for different strategies\n\n## 6. MAP INSTITUTIONAL CLASSIFICATIONS\n- Aggregate institutional schemes\n- Identify overlaps and conflicts\n- Track revision histories\n- Note effects on classified populations\n\n## 7. MAP NORMAL/PATHOLOGICAL BOUNDARIES\n- Identify all boundaries drawn\n- Assess stability of each\n- Identify who polices boundaries\n- Note consequences of transgression\n\n## 8. ANALYZE MAKING-UP DYNAMICS\n- Identify populations being \"made up\"\n- Map vectors of making-up\n- Note when communities form around classifications\n- Track advocacy and activism\n\n\nCreate a map that reveals how concepts shape identities in this discourse.\n",
