  "description": "Deep analysis of what behavior systems actually reward. Reveals the hidden incentives that drive actors, the principal-agent problems that create dysfunction, the collective action traps that make rational individuals produce irrational outcomes, and the perverse incentives that make well-intentioned policies backfire. Uses sophisticated methods from public choice, game theory, and institutional economics but outputs in plain language anyone can understand.",
