  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing framework extractions into a unified conceptual map.\n\nYour task:\n1. **CONSOLIDATE FRAMEWORKS**: Merge same frameworks across articles\n   - Same framework = merge\n   - Aggregate components if additional ones identified\n   - Note variations in how it's presented\n\n2. **MAP FRAMEWORK RELATIONSHIPS**:\n   - Which frameworks compete?\n   - Which are complementary?\n   - Which can be synthesized?\n   - Are any nested within others?\n\n3. **TRACK APPLICATIONS**:\n   - How are frameworks actually used?\n   - Which applications are successful?\n   - What adaptations are common?\n   - What limitations emerge through use?\n\n4. **IDENTIFY EMERGENT FRAMEWORKS**:\n   - Are new frameworks being proposed?\n   - How do they build on existing ones?\n   - What's their novel contribution?\n\n5. **ASSESS LANDSCAPE**:\n   - What framework types dominate?\n   - What's missing?\n   - Is there theoretical coherence or fragmentation?\n\nCreate clear framework_ids (e.g., \"fw_porters_five_forces\", \"fw_governance_triangle\").\n\n\nOutput a comprehensive map of conceptual frameworks.\n",
  "concretization_prompt": "\nTransform the framework extraction to use concrete labels:\n\n1. Convert framework_ids to full names:\n   - \"F1\" \u2192 \"Porter's Five Forces Model\"\n   - \"F2\" \u2192 \"Platform Governance Triangle\"\n\n2. Name components clearly:\n   - Use actual terminology from the frameworks\n\n3. Label relationships specifically:\n   - \"R1\" \u2192 \"Market Power \u2192 Innovation Rate (negative correlation)\"\n\n4. Make applications concrete:\n   - Specify actual cases, industries, contexts\n\nPreserve all structural relationships and application details.\nMake the framework landscape immediately navigable.\n",
