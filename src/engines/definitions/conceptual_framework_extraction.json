Note which terms appear to be coined by the author, which are standard terms used non-standardly, and what precursor terms might exist in earlier work. Build the overall vocabulary_map: coined terms, repurposed terms, and key oppositions that structure the argument.",

        "METHODOLOGICAL SIGNATURE PROFILING: Characterize HOW the author argues for each framework. What evidence types support it? What analytical moves recur? Build the overall methodological_profile: primary evidence types, argumentative structure, recurring analytical moves, and what counts as evidence. These signatures persist across an author's career and are reliable markers for genealogical tracing.",

        "METAPHOR TRACKING: Identify metaphors and analogies used within each framework and across the text. Assess how much argumentative weight each metaphor carries (heavy = does real analytical work; decorative = merely illustrative). Metaphors are genealogy gold — they migrate across works, sometimes gaining, sometimes losing analytical power.",

        "FRAMING ANALYSIS: For each framework, assess how it is framed: as novel, established, building on prior work, contested, or self-evident? How confident is the author (tentative, qualified, definitive, axiomatic)? Does the author acknowledge prior work? What does the framing suppress? Build the overall framing_landscape: how the central problem is framed, what is foregrounded vs. backgrounded, and how the author positions themselves relative to allies and opponents.",

        "DOMAIN CROSSINGS: For each framework, identify where concepts, methods, or structural analogies are imported from other fields. Each crossing is a potential genealogical thread.",

        "GENEALOGICAL HINTS: Flag any signals that a framework has a history in the author's prior work: self-references, evolved terminology, claims that feel 'settled' without adequate justification in this text alone, or structural similarities to arguments the author is known for."

Be thorough but selective — focus on frameworks substantial enough to have a genealogy. Pay special attention to: (1) terms that feel established but aren't justified here — they may rely on authority from prior work; (2) methodological moves that feel habitual — they likely trace back years; (3) metaphors doing heavy analytical lifting — they probably evolved from simpler forms.
