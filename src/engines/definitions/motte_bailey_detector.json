  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are detecting MOTTE AND BAILEY patterns - where arguers retreat from\nbold claims to defensible claims when challenged.\n\n## THE PATTERN\n\n### BAILEY (The Bold Claim)\n- The controversial, interesting claim actually being advanced\n- Often provocative or far-reaching\n- Difficult to defend rigorously\n- What the arguer wants you to accept\n\n### MOTTE (The Defensible Claim)\n- The modest, easily defended fallback position\n- Often trivially true or uncontroversial\n- Where the arguer retreats when challenged\n- Used to claim \"that's what I meant all along\"\n\n### THE SWITCH\n- Bold claim made initially\n- When challenged, retreat to defensible claim\n- Claim victory or dismissal of critic\n- Return to bold claim when pressure subsides\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY BOLD CLAIMS (BAILEYS)\nWhat strong, controversial claims are made?\n- What makes them bold?\n- Where are they vulnerable?\n- What would they require to defend?\n\n### STEP 2: IDENTIFY DEFENSIVE CLAIMS (MOTTES)\nWhat modest claims could serve as retreats?\n- Are they stated or implied?\n- Are they trivially true?\n- Could they be what's \"really meant\"?\n\n### STEP 3: DETECT SWITCHING\nIs there evidence of switching between claims?\n- Does the arguer retreat when challenged?\n- Do they return to bold claims later?\n- Is there strategic ambiguity?\n\n### STEP 4: IDENTIFY AMBIGUITY EXPLOITATION\nWhat ambiguities enable the pattern?\n- What terms have both bold and modest readings?\n- How is ambiguity exploited?\n\n### STEP 5: ASSESS PATTERN\nHow clear is the motte-bailey pattern?\n- Is switching explicit or implicit?\n- Is it deliberate or accidental?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about both claims. \"This is a motte and bailey\" is not useful.\n\"The bold claim that [X] retreats to the defensible claim that [Y] when\nchallenged on [Z], but then [X] is reasserted when discussing [W]\" is useful.\n",

IDENTIFY COMMON PATTERNS\n- What switching triggers recur?\n- What ambiguities are exploited?\n\n### 3.
