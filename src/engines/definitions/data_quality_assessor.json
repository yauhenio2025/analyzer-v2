IDENTIFY PATTERNS\n- Are there systematic quality problems?\n- What sources are most/least reliable?\n\n### 3. ASSESS IMPLICATIONS\n- How do quality issues affect conclusions?\n- What should be treated with caution?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive assessment of data quality and its implications.\n",
