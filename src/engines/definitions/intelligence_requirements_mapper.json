  "description": "Deep analysis mapping intelligence findings to requirements using CIA Structured Analytic Techniques and NIE methodology. Applies Heuer's cognitive bias mitigation framework, Grabo's indications and warning methodology, Jervis's perception/misperception analysis, and tradecraft standards for source evaluation. Reveals which Priority Intelligence Requirements are addressed, identifies collection gaps, surfaces linchpin assumptions that could invalidate key judgments, generates alternative hypotheses, and assesses analytic confidence with explicit reasoning. Maps the full intelligence cycle from requirements through collection, analysis, and dissemination. Essential for all-source analysis, estimative intelligence, strategic warning, and intelligence gap identification.",

      "extraction_steps": [
        "STEP 1 - IDENTIFY THE REQUIREMENTS HIERARCHY: Following CIA tradecraft standards, identify Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) - the highest-level questions the intelligence consumer needs answered. These are decision-focused: what does the policymaker/commander need to know to act? Decompose each PIR into Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs) - the specific analytic questions that together would satisfy the PIR. For each KIQ, identify the Essential Elements of Information (EEIs) - the specific facts, capabilities, intentions, or relationships that must be known to answer the KIQ.",
        "STEP 2 - MAP FINDINGS TO REQUIREMENTS: For each analytic finding in the documents, trace which EEIs it satisfies (fully, partially, or tangentially), which KIQs it addresses, and ultimately which PIRs it contributes to. Apply Heuer's guidance: distinguish between what the evidence actually shows versus what we infer. Mark satisfaction levels precisely - avoid the 'partially addressed' trap where everything is partially addressed.",
        "STEP 3 - IDENTIFY INTELLIGENCE GAPS: Using the requirements hierarchy, systematically identify gaps - information we need but don't have. Classify gaps by type: collection gaps (information exists but we can't get it), analytic gaps (we have information but haven't made sense of it), dissemination gaps (analysis exists but hasn't reached consumers). For each gap, assess severity by asking: what decisions cannot be made without this information?",
        "STEP 4 - ASSESS SOURCES USING TRADECRAFT STANDARDS: For each source report, apply the standard reliability/credibility matrix. Source reliability (A-F): Based on source's history, access, and motivation. Information credibility (1-6): Based on consistency, corroboration, and plausibility. Apply Jervis's perception filters: Is the source telling us what we want to hear? Are we accepting this because it confirms our existing view? Watch for deception indicators per Heuer's guidance.",
        "STEP 5 - SURFACE AND TEST ASSUMPTIONS (Key Assumptions Check): Following Heuer's Key Assumptions Check methodology: List every assumption underlying each finding (explicit and implicit). For each assumption, ask: (a) Why do we believe this? (b) How confident are we? (c) What would we see if it were wrong? (d) What are the consequences if it's wrong? Identify linchpin assumptions - those where being wrong would fundamentally change the conclusion.",
        "STEP 6 - GENERATE ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES (ACH): Apply Analysis of Competing Hypotheses per Heuer: For each major finding, generate at least 2-3 alternative explanations. Include a deception hypothesis where relevant. Include a null hypothesis (nothing significant is happening). For each hypothesis, list evidence consistent and inconsistent. Identify diagnostic evidence that would discriminate between hypotheses. Rate each hypothesis's current standing.",
        "STEP 7 - BUILD INDICATOR LISTS (Grabo I&W Methodology): Following Grabo's indications and warning framework: Identify observable events/conditions that would signal key developments. Distinguish leading indicators (early warning) from lagging indicators (confirmation). For each indicator, establish baseline (what's normal) and threshold (what triggers concern). Assess current indicator status across the list. Watch for denial and deception that could mask indicators.",
        "STEP 8 - ASSESS WARNING POSTURE: Synthesize indicator status into warning assessments. Following Grabo: distinguish strategic warning (weeks-months notice of major developments) from tactical warning (hours-days notice of imminent events). Assess surprise potential - how might we be caught off guard? Identify most dangerous assumptions - what are we betting on that could be wrong?",
        "STEP 9 - APPLY DEVIL'S ADVOCACY: For each major judgment, construct the strongest argument against it. Not strawman disagreement but genuinely thoughtful contrary analysis. What evidence would the devil's advocate cite? What logical problems would they identify? What assumptions would they challenge? Document the argument and the response.",
        "STEP 10 - CONDUCT RED TEAM ANALYSIS: For adversary-related analysis, adopt adversary perspective per red team methodology. How does this look from their side? What are their options we haven't considered? Where might they see our vulnerabilities? What might they be doing that we're not seeing? Apply Team A/Team B approach where appropriate.",
        "STEP 11 - ASSESS ANALYTIC CONFIDENCE (NIE Standards): For each major finding, estimate, or warning, provide explicit confidence assessment following NIE standards. Confidence is based on: (a) quantity and quality of sources, (b) degree of corroboration, (c) analyst expertise, (d) information gaps, (e) assumption sensitivity, (f) strength of alternative hypotheses. Use low/moderate/high and explain the basis. Identify what would increase or decrease confidence.",
        "STEP 12 - GENERATE COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS: For each significant gap, generate specific collection requirements. Specify: What exactly needs to be collected? Which INT is best positioned? What's the collection window? What are the risks? What's the expected yield? Prioritize collection requirements by impact on key judgments.",

Document where biases may be affecting judgment."
