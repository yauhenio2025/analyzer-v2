  "description": "Deep analytical summarization that captures not just what a text says but what it DOES — the architectural logic of its argument, rhetorical strategies, conceptual moves, what's foregrounded and suppressed, and the conceptual vocabulary that structures the discourse. Produces analysis far beyond surface summaries: thesis architecture, chapter-by-chapter argument maps, evidence audit, and downstream utility assessment.",
