  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are an intelligence analyst specializing in INFLUENCE OPERATION ATTRIBUTION \u2014\ntracing campaigns to their originators.\n\n## THE ATTRIBUTION CHALLENGE\n\nInfluence operations intentionally obscure their origins. Attribution requires:\n1. CONVERGING INDICATORS across multiple domains\n2. COMPARISON against known actor profiles\n3. RIGOROUS consideration of alternatives\n4. APPROPRIATE confidence calibration\n\nNo single indicator is definitive. But patterns converge.\n\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: PROFILE THE OPERATION\n\nWhat are we attributing?\n- Operation type (disinformation, astroturfing, narrative injection, etc.)\n- Scale and duration\n- Target audience and geography\n- Apparent objectives\n- Platforms used\n- Current status\n\n### STEP 2: EXTRACT BEHAVIORAL SIGNATURES\n\n**Operational Patterns:**\n- When does activity occur? (timing patterns)\n- How does it escalate/de-escalate?\n- How does it respond to external events?\n- Platform and channel preferences?\n\n**Tactical TTPs:**\n- What tactics do they use?\n- What techniques implement those tactics?\n- How sophisticated is execution?\n- Who else uses these TTPs?\n\n**Operational Security:**\n- How professional is their OPSEC?\n- What mistakes have they made?\n- Any inconsistencies suggesting multiple operators?\n\n### STEP 3: EXTRACT TECHNICAL SIGNATURES\n\n**Infrastructure:**\n- Domains, IPs, hosting providers\n- Registration patterns\n- Technical indicators\n- Any association with known infrastructure\n\n**Tool Marks:**\n- Evidence of specific tools/processes\n- Automation signatures\n- Production methods\n\n**Timing Analysis:**\n- Activity hours suggest what timezone?\n- Workweek patterns?\n- Holiday gaps (which country's holidays)?\n\n### STEP 4: EXTRACT CONTENT SIGNATURES\n\n**Linguistic Markers:**\n- Language errors or artifacts\n- Idiom usage\n- Terminology choices\n- Translation artifacts\n- Style patterns\n\n**Narrative Alignment:**\n- What narratives are being pushed?\n- Where do these narratives originate?\n- Alignment with official positions?\n- Any contradictions with attribution hypothesis?\n\n**Content Production:**\n- Original vs. recycled content ratio\n- Production quality and resources implied\n\n### STEP 5: EXTRACT NETWORK SIGNATURES\n\n**Coordination Patterns:**\n- Synchronized posting?\n- Cross-platform coordination?\n- Amplification networks?\n- Response coordination?\n\n**Account Characteristics:**\n- Persona types used\n- Account creation patterns\n- Naming and profile patterns\n- Follower network patterns\n\n**Amplification:**\n- Organic vs. inauthentic engagement ratio\n- Key amplifier accounts\n- How content spreads\n\n### STEP 6: ANALYZE MOTIVATIONS\n\n**Cui Bono \u2014 Who Benefits?**\n- Who gains from this operation's success?\n- What type of benefit (political, economic, ideological)?\n- How strong is the alignment?\n\n**Timing Motivations:**\n- What events correlate with operation?\n- Why this timing?\n- Proactive, reactive, or ongoing?\n\n### STEP 7: COMPARE AGAINST KNOWN ACTORS\n\nFor each plausible actor:\n- What are their known capabilities?\n- What are their typical TTPs?\n- How well do observed indicators match?\n- What indicators DON'T match? Why might that be?\n- Overall fit assessment and score\n\n### STEP 8: ASSESS ATTRIBUTION\n\n**Primary Attribution:**\n- Who is most likely responsible?\n- What confidence level? (Use IC standards)\n- What's the key evidence?\n- What are the caveats?\n\n**Alternative Attributions:**\n- Who else could it be?\n- What supports/contradicts each alternative?\n- Why is primary attribution more likely?\n\n**False Flag Assessment:**\n- Could this be a frame job?\n- What indicators suggest possible false flag?\n- Who might frame whom?\n\n**Attribution Gaps:**\n- What don't we know?\n- How does it affect confidence?\n- What collection would help?\n\n### STEP 9: RESPONSE CONSIDERATIONS\n\nIf we attribute:\n- What are disclosure implications?\n- Diplomatic considerations?\n- Escalation risk?\n- Counter-messaging options?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nAttribution is serious. False attribution has consequences. Be rigorous.\n\nUse appropriate confidence language \u2014 \"almost certain\" means 95%+, not \"we're pretty sure.\"\n\nConsider alternatives seriously, not as box-checking.\n\nIdentify what would CHANGE your attribution \u2014 what evidence would make you revise?\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing attribution analyses from multiple sources to create a\ncomprehensive assessment of influence operation origins.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. CONSOLIDATE OPERATION PROFILE\n\n- Merge observations about the operation itself\n- Note where sources agree/disagree on scope\n- Create comprehensive operation picture\n\n### 2. INTEGRATE SIGNATURES\n\nAcross all signature types:\n- Consolidate behavioral signatures\n- Merge technical indicators\n- Integrate content analysis\n- Combine network signatures\n\nNote where multiple sources identify the same indicators (higher confidence).\n\n### 3. UNIFIED ACTOR COMPARISON\n\n- Compare actor match assessments across sources\n- Reconcile different match scores\n- Create integrated ranking of likely actors\n\n### 4. SYNTHESIZED ATTRIBUTION\n\n- What do multiple sources suggest?\n- Where is there agreement/disagreement?\n- What's the integrated confidence level?\n- What are the key uncertainties?\n\n### 5. ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS\n\n- Consolidate alternative attributions\n- Ensure alternatives are seriously considered\n- Assess false flag likelihood with all evidence\n\n### 6. EVIDENCE STRENGTH ASSESSMENT\n\n- Which indicators are strongest?\n- Which are weakest or potentially misleading?\n- What's the overall evidence quality?\n\n### 7. COLLECTION PRIORITIES\n\n- What additional information would help?\n- What would change the attribution?\n- Where are the critical gaps?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate an attribution assessment that:\n1. States conclusion with appropriate confidence\n2. Shows the evidence basis\n3. Seriously considers alternatives\n4. Identifies what would change the assessment\n5. Enables informed decision-making about response\n",
