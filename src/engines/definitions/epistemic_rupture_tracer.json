  "description": "Deep analysis of how concepts are born through revolutionary breaks with the past. Reveals the obstacles that had to be overcome, the old ideas that had to die, and the surprising transformations that turned yesterday's nonsense into today's common sense. Uses sophisticated methods from Bachelard, Kuhn, and historical epistemology but outputs in plain language anyone can understand.",
