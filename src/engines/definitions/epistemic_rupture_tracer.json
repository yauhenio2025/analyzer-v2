  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in historical epistemology in the tradition of Bachelard and Canguilhem.\n\nFor this article, perform an EPISTEMIC RUPTURE ANALYSIS:\n\n## 1. CONCEPT GENEALOGY\nFor each significant concept:\n- **Current meaning**: How is it used now?\n- **Emergence period**: When did this concept appear in its current form?\n- **Origin context**: What circumstances gave birth to it?\n- **Field of origin**: What discipline/domain first deployed it?\n\n## 2. PREDECESSOR HUNTING\nFor each concept, investigate:\n- **What did this replace?** What earlier concept(s) occupied this conceptual space?\n- **What was preserved?** What continuities exist with predecessors?\n- **What was abandoned?** What aspects of the predecessor were rejected?\n- **What was added?** What new elements distinguish this concept?\n\n## 3. RUPTURE IDENTIFICATION\nLook for epistemic breaks:\n- **Where is there discontinuity?** Where did smooth evolution fail?\n- **What triggered the break?** Discovery, crisis, controversy?\n- **Who drove it?** Key figures in the transformation\n- **What died?** What concepts became obsolete?\n- **What was born?** What new conceptual possibilities emerged?\n\n## 4. OBSTACLE ARCHAEOLOGY\nIdentify epistemological obstacles (Bachelard's obstacles \u00e9pist\u00e9mologiques):\n- **Common sense obstacles**: Folk intuitions that blocked understanding\n- **Verbal obstacles**: Words that misled thinking\n- **Substantialist obstacles**: Treating abstractions as substances\n- **Prior scientific obstacles**: Old science blocking new science\n- **How were they overcome?** What allowed transcendence?\n\n## 5. BEFORE/AFTER ANALYSIS\nFor major conceptual shifts:\n- **Before landscape**: What was thinkable before?\n- **After landscape**: What became thinkable after?\n- **Newly visible**: What could now be seen?\n- **Newly invisible**: What dropped out of view?\n\n\nThink genealogically - trace the lineage of ideas, not their logical justification.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing epistemic rupture analyses from multiple articles into a genealogical map.\n\nYour task:\n\n## 1. CONSOLIDATE CONCEPT GENEALOGIES\n- Merge genealogical information across articles\n- Build complete lineage chains where possible\n- Track conceptual evolution trajectories\n\n## 2. MAP EPISTEMIC RUPTURES\n- Identify ruptures mentioned across articles\n- Classify rupture types:\n  - **Complete break**: Old concept entirely abandoned\n  - **Partial reconfiguration**: Core preserved, context changed\n  - **Inversion**: Meaning reversed\n  - **Synthesis**: Multiple predecessors combined\n  - **Differentiation**: Concept splits into multiple successors\n- Rate rupture magnitude (revolutionary \u2192 minor)\n\n## 3. BUILD PREDECESSOR NETWORKS\n- Connect successor concepts to predecessors\n- Identify orphan concepts (no clear predecessors)\n- Identify extinct concepts (no successors)\n- Map concept family trees\n\n## 4. CATALOG EPISTEMOLOGICAL OBSTACLES\n- Consolidate obstacles across articles\n- Identify persistent obstacles (still affecting thinking)\n- Map which obstacles blocked which concepts\n\n## 5. RECONSTRUCT COGNITIVE LANDSCAPES\n- Build \"before\" and \"after\" snapshots for major ruptures\n- Identify what became thinkable/unthinkable\n- Map blind spots of each era\n\n## 6. TRACE GENEALOGICAL LINEAGES\n- Build complete concept sequence chains\n- Calculate semantic distance across lineages\n- Identify terminological vs. structural continuity\n\n\nCreate a map that reveals the archaeological layers of conceptual history.\n",
  "concretization_prompt": "\nTransform the genealogical analysis to use concrete, historically-grounded labels:\n\n1. Name concepts with their historical markers:\n   - \"C1\" \u2192 \"Phlogiston (pre-Lavoisier combustion theory)\"\n   - \"C2\" \u2192 \"Oxygen (Lavoisier 1789)\"\n\n2. Name ruptures with memorable descriptions:\n   - \"R1\" \u2192 \"The Chemical Revolution (1770s-1780s)\"\n   - \"R2\" \u2192 \"The Probabilistic Turn in Quantum Mechanics\"\n\n3. Name obstacles concretely:\n   - \"O1\" \u2192 \"The Substance Fallacy in Heat Theory\"\n   - \"O2\" \u2192 \"The Determinism Obstacle\"\n\n4. Name transformation events with specifics:\n   - \"TE1\" \u2192 \"Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962)\"\n\n5. Name cognitive landscapes evocatively:\n   - \"CL1\" \u2192 \"The Mechanistic Worldview (1600-1900)\"\n   - \"CL2\" \u2192 \"The Information Age Episteme\"\n\nPreserve all temporal relationships, rupture magnitudes, and genealogical connections.\nMake the history of concepts immediately graspable.\n",
