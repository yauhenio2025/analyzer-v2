  "researcher_question": "Is this phenomenon speeding up, slowing down, or at an inflection point?",
  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are analyzing VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION - the rates of change and\nhow those rates themselves are changing.\n\n## KEY CONCEPTS\n\n### VELOCITY (First Derivative)\nHow fast is something changing?\n- Rapid increase\n- Gradual increase\n- Stable\n- Gradual decrease\n- Rapid decrease\n\n### ACCELERATION (Second Derivative)\nIs the rate of change itself changing?\n- Accelerating: Change is speeding up\n- Constant: Change continues at same rate\n- Decelerating: Change is slowing down\n\n### INFLECTION POINTS\nWhere does the nature of change change?\n- Reversal: Direction changes\n- Acceleration shift: Speed of change changes\n- Saturation onset: Limits start binding\n- Breakthrough: Constraints removed\n\n### SATURATION\nAre there limits to change?\n- What constrains further change?\n- How close to limits?\n- What happens at saturation?\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY PHENOMENA\nWhat phenomena are described that change over time?\n- What's being measured?\n- Over what time period?\n- What's the data quality?\n\n### STEP 2: ASSESS VELOCITY\nHow fast is each phenomenon changing?\n- What's the current rate of change?\n- How does this compare to historical rates?\n- What's driving the velocity?\n\n### STEP 3: ASSESS ACCELERATION\nIs the rate of change itself changing?\n- Is change speeding up or slowing down?\n- What's causing acceleration/deceleration?\n- Where is this heading?\n\n### STEP 4: IDENTIFY INFLECTION POINTS\nAre there or will there be inflection points?\n- Where does/will direction change?\n- Where does/will rate change?\n- What evidence suggests inflection?\n\n### STEP 5: ASSESS SATURATION\nAre there limits to change?\n- What constraints exist?\n- How close to saturation?\n- What happens at limits?\n\n### STEP 6: PROJECT TRAJECTORIES\nWhere does current trajectory lead?\n- If trends continue?\n- Key uncertainties?\n- Potential disruptions?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about rates and changes. \"Things are changing fast\" is not\nuseful. \"The rate of adoption increased 40% annually until 2020, then\ndecelerated to 15% annually, suggesting approaching saturation of early\nadopter segment\" is useful.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing velocity and acceleration analyses across multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. AGGREGATE DYNAMICS\n- What phenomena are tracked?\n- What velocity patterns appear?\n- What acceleration trends?\n\n### 2. IDENTIFY INFLECTIONS\n- What inflection points appear across sources?\n- What drives them?\n\n### 3. ASSESS TRAJECTORIES\n- Where are things heading?\n- What saturation effects appear?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive map of temporal dynamics and their implications.\n",
