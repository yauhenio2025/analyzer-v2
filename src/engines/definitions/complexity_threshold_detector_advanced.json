  "description": "Deep analysis of complexity dynamics using Snowden's Cynefin framework and Santa Fe complexity science. Detects domain positions (clear, complicated, complex, chaotic, confused), identifies threshold crossings and phase transitions, reveals fitness landscapes and attractor basins, maps adaptive agent co-evolution, and diagnoses method mismatches where linear approaches are misapplied to non-linear domains. Reveals where systems are poised at the edge of chaos, where positive feedback creates lock-in, and where requisite variety is insufficient for the complexity faced. Based on the work of Snowden, Kauffman, Holland, and Arthur.",

        "STEP 1: IDENTIFY SYSTEM BOUNDARIES - Define what system is being discussed. Apply Snowden's principle: boundaries are judgments, not discoveries. Note what is included, excluded, and why. Identify the time horizon being considered.",
        "STEP 2: ASSESS CYNEFIN DOMAIN - For each system/situation, determine which Cynefin domain it occupies. Ask: (a) Is cause-and-effect relationship obvious to all? \u2192 Clear domain. (b) Is cause-and-effect discoverable through analysis? \u2192 Complicated domain. (c) Is cause-and-effect only coherent in retrospect? \u2192 Complex domain. (d) Is there no perceivable cause-and-effect relationship? \u2192 Chaotic domain. (e) Is it unclear which domain applies? \u2192 Confused (disorder).",
        "STEP 3: IDENTIFY COMPLEXITY INDICATORS - Collect evidence for domain assessment. Look for: predictability of outcomes, linearity of cause-effect, agent homogeneity/heterogeneity, feedback loop dominance, sensitivity to initial conditions, emergence of novel patterns, expert agreement/disagreement, success of prediction attempts.",
        "STEP 4: MAP ADAPTIVE AGENTS - Identify agents that adapt their behavior based on outcomes. Apply Holland's criteria: Do they have internal models? Do they modify behavior? Do they interact with other adaptive agents? Note their adaptation speed, what they optimize for, and their interaction patterns.",
        "STEP 5: CHART FITNESS LANDSCAPES (Kauffman) - For systems with adaptive agents, characterize the fitness landscape. Is it smooth (easy optimization), rugged (many local optima), or deformable (changes as agents adapt)? Note NK-style correlations: How does changing one 'gene' affect fitness in other dimensions?",
        "STEP 6: IDENTIFY ATTRACTORS AND BASINS - Find states the system tends toward. Apply dynamical systems thinking: What are the stable states? What are the basins of attraction? How sharp or fuzzy are basin boundaries? Note whether attractors are beneficial, harmful, or context-dependent.",
        "STEP 7: LOCATE BIFURCATION POINTS - Identify potential tipping points where small parameter changes could cause qualitative shifts. Look for early warning signals per Scheffer: critical slowing down, increased variance, flickering between states. Note control parameters and their current values relative to critical thresholds.",
        "STEP 8: TRACE EMERGENCE PATTERNS - Identify macro-level patterns arising from micro-level interactions. Apply Holland's criteria: Is the pattern irreducible to components? Does it exhibit downward causation? What local rules generate it? Note whether emergence is expected or surprising.",
        "STEP 9: MAP FEEDBACK MECHANISMS - Identify reinforcing (positive) and balancing (negative) feedback loops. Note loop polarity, strength, delays, and current state (dormant, active, saturated). Apply Meadows' hierarchy: which loops are dominant?",
        "STEP 10: DETECT PATH DEPENDENCIES (Arthur) - Find where history constrains current options. Identify increasing returns mechanisms: network effects, learning effects, coordination effects, adaptive expectations. Note lock-in depth and switching costs.",
        "STEP 11: ASSESS PHASE TRANSITIONS - Identify where systems undergo qualitative reorganization. Look for order parameters that change discontinuously. Note whether transitions are first-order (discontinuous) or second-order (continuous), reversible or irreversible.",
        "STEP 12: EVALUATE RESPONSE STRATEGIES - For each domain assessment, identify what response strategies are being used or recommended. Match to Cynefin prescriptions: Clear \u2192 Best practice (sense-categorize-respond), Complicated \u2192 Good practice (sense-analyze-respond), Complex \u2192 Emergent practice (probe-sense-respond), Chaotic \u2192 Novel practice (act-sense-respond).",
        "STEP 13: DIAGNOSE METHOD MISMATCHES - Find where approaches appropriate to one domain are being applied to another. Common mismatches: Complicated methods (expert analysis, planning) applied to Complex domains; Clear-domain assumptions (best practices exist) in Complex situations; Failure to act in Chaos while waiting for analysis.",
        "STEP 14: APPLY ASHBY'S LAW - Assess requisite variety. Does the controller (manager, regulator, organization) have variety matching the variety of the situation? Identify variety amplifiers (increasing response repertoire) and attenuators (reducing situation complexity).",

In complex domains, DO NOT recommend expert analysis as primary response; recommend probes. Watch for the temptation to treat everything as complicated - this is the most common mismatch."
