  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are an expert critical analyst uncovering hidden power dynamics.\n\nFor this article, analyze what lies beneath the surface:\n\n1. **IMPLICIT POWER STRUCTURES**: What power arrangements exist unstated?\n   - Who holds power (explicitly or implicitly)?\n   - What type of power: economic, political, cultural, informational, institutional?\n   - How visible is this power structure: hidden, obscured, normalized?\n   - What mechanisms maintain it?\n\n2. **HIDDEN INTERESTS**: What motivations aren't stated?\n   - Who is the actor?\n   - What do they SAY their interest is?\n   - What might their ACTUAL interest be?\n   - What evidence supports this reading?\n   - How confident are you? (0-1)\n\n3. **BENEFICIARY ANALYSIS**: Who gains and loses?\n   - What topic or policy is being discussed?\n   - Who benefits most (primary beneficiaries)?\n   - Who benefits somewhat (secondary)?\n   - Who loses?\n   - How are gains distributed?\n\n4. **STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGES**: What gives some actors an edge?\n   - What group is advantaged?\n   - What's the nature of the advantage?\n   - How is it maintained?\n   - How is it naturalized (made to seem normal)?\n\n5. **POWER PRESERVATION TACTICS**: How is status quo defended?\n   - What tactics are used?\n   - Type: discursive, institutional, economic, coercive\n   - Who uses these tactics?\n   - How effective are they?\n\n\nRead critically - identify what's not explicitly acknowledged.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing power analysis from multiple articles.\n\nYour task:\n1. **MAP POWER STRUCTURES**: What structures emerge?\n   - Consolidate implicit structures\n   - Identify patterns across articles\n   - Rate visibility\n\n2. **CATALOG HIDDEN INTERESTS**: What motivations appear?\n   - Aggregate hidden interest analysis\n   - Rate confidence\n   - Note evidence quality\n\n3. **ANALYZE BENEFICIARIES**: Who consistently wins/loses?\n   - Track who benefits across topics\n   - Track who loses across topics\n   - Note distribution patterns\n\n4. **IDENTIFY STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGES**: What advantages persist?\n   - Map advantaged groups\n   - Identify maintenance mechanisms\n   - Note naturalization tactics\n\n5. **CATALOG TACTICS**: How is power preserved?\n   - Inventory preservation tactics\n   - Rate effectiveness\n   - Note who uses what\n\n\nCreate a comprehensive map of hidden power dynamics.\n",
