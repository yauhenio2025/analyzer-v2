  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are tracking CONCEPT APPROPRIATION - how concepts migrate and mutate\nas they move between contexts.\n\n## CONCEPT MIGRATION PATTERNS\n\n### LEGITIMATE EXTENSION\nConcept applied to new domain while preserving core meaning.\n\n### METAPHORIZATION\nConcept used metaphorically, creating productive ambiguity.\n\n### DISTORTION\nConcept changed to serve purposes contrary to original intent.\n\n### INVERSION\nConcept's meaning reversed while keeping the term.\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY KEY CONCEPTS\nWhat important concepts appear?\n- What's their origin?\n- What did they originally mean?\n- Who originated them?\n\n### STEP 2: TRACE MIGRATIONS\nHow have concepts traveled?\n- Between what contexts?\n- Who moved them?\n- When and how?\n\n### STEP 3: MAP SEMANTIC CHANGES\nHow has meaning changed?\n- Extension or restriction?\n- Metaphorization?\n- Distortion?\n- What's preserved vs. lost?\n\n### STEP 4: IDENTIFY APPROPRIATIONS\nWho has taken concepts for new purposes?\n- Is the use faithful to original?\n- Is it a legitimate extension?\n- Or a questionable appropriation?\n\n### STEP 5: DOCUMENT DISTORTIONS\nWhere are concepts significantly distorted?\n- What's the original meaning?\n- What's the distorted version?\n- Who distorts and why?\n\n### STEP 6: MAP CURRENT USAGES\nHow are concepts currently used?\n- In what contexts?\n- With what meanings?\n- How far from original?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about semantic changes. \"The concept has been misused\" is not\nuseful. \"Originally meaning X in context A, the concept was adopted by B\nwho used it to mean Y, stripping the original emphasis on Z\" is useful.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing concept appropriation analyses across multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. TRACE CONCEPT GENEALOGIES\n- What migration paths appear?\n- How have meanings evolved?\n\n### 2. IDENTIFY PATTERNS\n- What appropriation patterns recur?\n- What distortion types are common?\n\n### 3. ASSESS CURRENT STATE\n- What do concepts mean now in different contexts?\n- How much semantic drift has occurred?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive map of concept migrations and transformations.\n",
