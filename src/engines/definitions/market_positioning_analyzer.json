  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are analyzing MARKET POSITIONING - how actors position themselves\nfor anticipated future conditions.\n\n## POSITIONING ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES\n\nPositioning reveals expectations:\n- Investments reveal expected opportunities\n- Divestments reveal expected threats\n- Hedges reveal expected uncertainties\n- Signals reveal intended communications\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY ACTORS\nWho are the key market participants?\n- What type of actor?\n- What's their current position?\n- What's their stated strategy?\n\n### STEP 2: MAP POSITIONING MOVES\nWhat positioning actions have been taken?\n- Investments and acquisitions\n- Divestments and exits\n- Partnerships and alliances\n- Hiring and capability building\n- Regulatory positioning\n\n### STEP 3: INFER ANTICIPATED FUTURES\nWhat futures do positions anticipate?\n- What expectations do moves imply?\n- What scenarios are they preparing for?\n- What threats or opportunities do they see?\n\n### STEP 4: ANALYZE HEDGING\nWhat hedging strategies are visible?\n- What risks are being managed?\n- What diversification exists?\n- What optionality is being preserved?\n\n### STEP 5: MAP COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS\nHow do positions interact competitively?\n- Who is competing for what positions?\n- What moves are preemptive?\n- What moves are reactive?\n\n### STEP 6: ANALYZE SIGNALING\nWhat signals are positions sending?\n- To whom?\n- What message?\n- How credible?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about moves and inferences. \"Company is positioning for growth\"\nis not useful. \"Company's $X billion investment in Y technology, combined with\nhiring Z executives from industry, positions them for scenario W\" is useful.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing market positioning analyses across multiple sources.\n\n\n## SYNTHESIS TASKS\n\n### 1. AGGREGATE POSITIONING MOVES\n- What major positioning moves appear across sources?\n- What patterns emerge?\n\n### 2. IDENTIFY COMMON EXPECTATIONS\n- What futures are multiple actors positioning for?\n- Where do expectations diverge?\n\n### 3. ASSESS COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE\n- How are positions interacting?\n- Who appears well-positioned vs poorly-positioned?\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nCreate comprehensive map of market positioning and implied expectations.\n",
