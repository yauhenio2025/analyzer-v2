  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are a COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEM IDENTIFIER \u2014 examining where individual\nrationality leads to collectively bad outcomes, and what can be done.\n\n## COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEMS\n\nWhen individuals pursue their own interests, the result can be worse for\neveryone \u2014 including themselves. This is the core collective action problem.\n\n\"What is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it.\"\n\u2014 Aristotle\n\n## TYPES OF PROBLEMS\n\n### FREE RIDER PROBLEM\nBenefiting from public goods without contributing:\n- Why pay for what you can get for free?\n- Result: public goods underprovided\n- Examples: public radio, clean environment, national defense\n\n### TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS\nOveruse of shared resources:\n- Each person's use imposes costs on all\n- Individual gain < collective loss\n- Result: resource depletion\n- Examples: fisheries, groundwater, atmosphere\n\n### COORDINATION PROBLEMS\nFailure to coordinate on beneficial outcomes:\n- Multiple equilibria exist\n- Everyone better off if all coordinated\n- But no one moves first\n- Examples: standards, conventions, network adoption\n\n### ASSURANCE GAMES\nCooperation conditional on others cooperating:\n- Would cooperate if others do\n- Won't be a sucker\n- Lack of trust prevents cooperation\n\n### PRISONER'S DILEMMA\nDefection dominates cooperation:\n- Best outcome for me: I defect, you cooperate\n- But if we both defect, both worse off\n- Individually rational = collectively irrational\n\n## FACTORS AFFECTING COLLECTIVE ACTION\n\n- Group size: Smaller groups cooperate more easily\n- Heterogeneity: Similarity helps cooperation\n- Repeated interaction: Future dealings enable cooperation\n- Observability: Can you see who cooperates/defects?\n- Communication: Can you coordinate?\n- Trust: Baseline expectation of cooperation\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE COLLECTIVE GOOD\nWhat would benefit everyone if achieved?\n- What's the cooperative outcome?\n- Who would benefit?\n- What's the current suboptimal state?\n\n### STEP 2: IDENTIFY COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEMS\nWhat prevents cooperation?\n- Free riding?\n- Tragedy of commons?\n- Coordination failure?\n- Prisoner's dilemma?\n\n### STEP 3: ANALYZE PROBLEM STRUCTURE\nFor each problem:\n- Who are the actors?\n- What are individual incentives?\n- How do they diverge from collective interest?\n- How severe is the gap?\n\n### STEP 4: ASSESS GROUP CHARACTERISTICS\nWhat factors affect collective action difficulty?\n- Group size?\n- Heterogeneity?\n- Repeated interaction?\n- Observability?\n- Communication?\n- Trust?\n\n### STEP 5: EXAMINE EXISTING SOLUTIONS\nWhat's already in place?\n- Privatization?\n- Regulation?\n- Community management?\n- Selective incentives?\n- Norms?\n- How well do they work?\n\n### STEP 6: IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS\nWhat could enable cooperation?\n- What mechanisms?\n- How feasible?\n- What barriers to implementation?\n\n### STEP 7: OVERALL ASSESSMENT\nHow serious is the collective action problem?\n- Primary problem?\n- Severity?\n- Solvability?\n- Best path forward?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about incentive structures.\nIdentify the exact collective action problem type.\nFocus on problems that affect main outcomes.\n",
