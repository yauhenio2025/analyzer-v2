  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in Quinean epistemology, analyzing concepts as nodes in a web of belief.\n\nFor this article, perform a CONCEPT CENTRALITY ANALYSIS:\n\n## 1. CONCEPT IDENTIFICATION\nFor each significant concept mentioned:\n- **Term**: The concept name/phrase\n- **Definition**: How it's defined or used in context\n- **Apparent centrality**: Does this seem core or peripheral to the argument?\n\n## 2. DEPENDENCY MAPPING\nFor each concept, identify:\n- **Definitional dependencies**: What concepts does its definition rely on?\n- **Inferential dependencies**: What concepts must be true for inferences involving this one?\n- **Presuppositional dependencies**: What must be taken for granted?\n- **Evidential dependencies**: What empirical claims support it?\n\n## 3. CENTRALITY ASSESSMENT\nEvaluate each concept's position:\n- **Distance from experience**: How many inferential steps from direct observation?\n  (0 = directly observable, 5 = highly theoretical)\n- **Revision cost**: What would revising this concept require?\n  - Catastrophic: Would require abandoning the entire framework\n  - Major: Would require significant restructuring\n  - Moderate: Would require adjusting related concepts\n  - Minor: Could be revised with local changes\n  - Trivial: Could be revised without affecting other concepts\n\n## 4. REMOVAL THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS\nFor key concepts, consider:\n- What would happen if we abandoned this concept?\n- What other concepts would become unstable?\n- What would need to be reconstructed?\n\n## 5. EMPIRICAL ANCHORS\nIdentify concepts with direct empirical grounding:\n- What observations/data anchor this concept?\n- How revisable is this empirical basis?\n\n## 6. LOAD-BEARING STRUCTURES\nIdentify conceptual structures that hold other concepts together:\n- What conceptual clusters function as units?\n- What enables/supports large portions of the argument?\n\n\nThink holistically - every concept connects to others. Map the web.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing concept centrality analyses from multiple articles into a unified web of belief map.\n\nYour task:\n\n## 1. CONSOLIDATE THE CONCEPT INVENTORY\n- Merge identical concepts across articles\n- Note definitional variations\n- Track which articles use which concepts\n\n## 2. BUILD THE MASTER DEPENDENCY GRAPH\n- Aggregate all dependency relationships\n- Identify transitive dependencies (A depends on B depends on C)\n- Calculate dependency depth for each concept\n\n## 3. COMPUTE CENTRALITY SCORES\nFor each concept, calculate centrality (0-1) based on:\n- How many other concepts depend on it (incoming edges)\n- How costly revision would be\n- How far from empirical grounding\n- Whether it appears across multiple articles\n\nAssign centrality tiers:\n- **Core** (0.8-1.0): Framework-defining concepts\n- **Near-core** (0.6-0.8): Major structural concepts\n- **Intermediate** (0.4-0.6): Important but revisable\n- **Peripheral** (0.2-0.4): Supporting concepts\n- **Edge** (0-0.2): Easily abandoned concepts\n\n## 4. PERFORM REMOVAL IMPACT ANALYSIS\nFor the most central concepts:\n- What would break if removed?\n- What cascade effects would occur?\n- What surviving concepts could rebuild from?\n\n## 5. IDENTIFY LOAD-BEARING STRUCTURES\n- Which concept clusters hold the web together?\n- What are the conceptual \"keystones\"?\n- Where are the vulnerabilities?\n\n## 6. MAP WEB TOPOLOGY\n- Calculate overall web coherence\n- Identify conceptual hubs\n- Find orphan/isolated concepts\n- Assess revision vulnerability\n\n\nCreate a map that reveals the hidden architecture of conceptual commitments.\n",
