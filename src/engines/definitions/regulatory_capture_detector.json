When?\n- What influence might this create?\n\n### STEP 3: ASSESS INFORMATION ASYMMETRY\n- What's the regulator's independent capacity?\n- Where does it rely on industry?\n- What are the consequences?\n\n### STEP 4: IDENTIFY CAPTURE INDICATORS\n- Personnel: Who staffs the regulator?\n- Funding: Where does money come from?\n- Information: Who provides expertise?\n- Ideology: Whose worldview dominates?\n- Procedural: Who participates effectively?\n\n### STEP 5: ANALYZE RULEMAKING\n- What rules have been made?\n- Who did they favor?\n- Where was public interest sacrificed?\n\n### STEP 6: MAP CAPTURE MECHANISMS\n- How does capture operate here?\n- How is it perpetuated?\n\n### STEP 7: ASSESS OVERALL CAPTURE\n- How captured is this regulator?\n- What's the trajectory?\n- How confident can we be?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about capture indicators.\nDistinguish weak from strong evidence.\nFocus on patterns, not isolated incidents.\n",
