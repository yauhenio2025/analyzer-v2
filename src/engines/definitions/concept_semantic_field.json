Short phrases are insufficient. We need enough context to see the concept operating in its argumentative environment.\n\n2. MULTIPLE QUOTES: For every major claim about a semantic neighbor, rhetorical deployment, tension, or definitional variation, provide MULTIPLE quotes (2-4). One quote is rarely enough to establish a pattern.\n\n3. CLOSE READING: Every quote must be accompanied by DETAILED ANALYSIS (3-5 sentences minimum). Don't just say 'this shows X.' Walk through exactly what words, phrases, sentence structures, or argumentative moves demonstrate your point. Be specific. Point to particular formulations. Explain the logic step by step.\n\n4. EXPLICIT CONNECTIONS: Never leave connections implicit. If you claim a quote demonstrates something, explain exactly HOW it demonstrates it. What specifically in the quote supports your claim? A reader should be able to follow your reasoning.\n\n5. ANALYTICAL NARRATIVE: Descriptions and explanations should be 2-5 sentences minimum, not brief labels. We want substantive analytical prose that teaches the reader something.\n\n6. AVOID SHALLOW ASSERTIONS: Phrases like 'this shows that...' or 'demonstrates how...' without detailed follow-through are insufficient. Earn your claims through textual evidence and explicit reasoning.\n\n7. CONTEXTUAL GROUNDING: Quotes should include enough surrounding text that we understand the argumentative context. Don't excerpt so narrowly that meaning is lost.\n\n8. CRITICAL STANCE: Look for tensions, ambiguities, weak points. Find places where the concept does questionable argumentative work. Be a critical reader, not a summarizer.\n\n9. DEFINITIONAL RICHNESS: For definitional variations, show how the same concept takes on different meanings in different contexts. Multiple extended quotes per variation, each with analysis.\n\n10. PRESUPPOSITIONAL DEPTH: Surface hidden assumptions by showing how the text relies on unstated premises. Quote passages where presuppositions are operating and explain what would change if they were rejected.\n\nTHE GOAL: A reader of this analysis should gain deep insight into how the concept functions as a tool of thought and persuasion, grounded in extensive textual evidence and rigorous close reading. This is scholarly analysis, not summary."
