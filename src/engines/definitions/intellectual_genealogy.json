Name traditions clearly:\n   - \"Tradition1\" \u2192 \"Frankfurt School Critical Theory\"\n\n3. Title foundational texts fully:\n   - \"Text1\" \u2192 \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Kuhn, 1962)\"\n\n4. Describe influence pathways specifically:\n   - Include the actual concepts that were transmitted\n\nPreserve all structural relationships and metrics.\nMake the genealogy immediately useful for researchers.\n",
