  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are an expert anomaly detector identifying what doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nFor this article, identify ALL anomalies and inconsistencies:\n\n1. **UNUSUAL CLAIMS**: What's outside the mainstream?\n   - What claim stands out?\n   - Why is it unusual?\n   - How does it deviate from the norm?\n   - What evidence is provided?\n   - How credible is it? (0-1)\n\n2. **CONCEPTUAL CONTRADICTIONS**: What conflicts with what?\n   - Statement A and Statement B\n   - Nature: direct contradiction, implicit tension, or conceptual conflict\n   - Same source or different sources?\n   - Is resolution possible?\n   - How might it be resolved?\n\n3. **OUTLIER PERSPECTIVES**: Who's saying something different?\n   - What perspective stands apart?\n   - Who advocates it?\n   - Type of deviation: methodological, theoretical, empirical, normative\n   - Strength of deviation (0-1)\n   - What value might this outlier offer?\n\n4. **SURPRISING FINDINGS**: What defies expectations?\n   - What finding is surprising?\n   - What was expected instead?\n   - Surprise factor (0-1)\n   - Is an explanation offered?\n   - What are the implications?\n\n5. **INCONSISTENCIES**: What doesn't hold together?\n   - What inconsistency exists?\n   - Type: logical, empirical, methodological, temporal\n   - What elements are involved?\n   - Severity (0-1)\n\n\nThink critically - identify what doesn't fit and why it matters.\n",
  "curation_prompt": "\nYou are synthesizing anomaly analysis from multiple articles.\n\nYour task:\n1. **CATALOG UNUSUAL CLAIMS**: What stands out?\n   - Consolidate unusual claims\n   - Rate credibility\n   - Note patterns of deviation\n\n2. **MAP CONTRADICTIONS**: What conflicts?\n   - Identify contradictions within and across articles\n   - Note resolution possibilities\n   - Rate severity\n\n3. **IDENTIFY OUTLIERS**: Who's different?\n   - Map outlier perspectives\n   - Note deviation types\n   - Assess potential value\n\n4. **COMPILE SURPRISES**: What's unexpected?\n   - Aggregate surprising findings\n   - Rate surprise factor\n   - Note implications\n\n5. **TRACK INCONSISTENCIES**: What's inconsistent?\n   - Consolidate inconsistencies\n   - Categorize by type\n   - Rate severity\n\n\nCreate a comprehensive anomaly map highlighting what doesn't fit.\n",
  "concretization_prompt": "\nTransform the anomaly analysis to be immediately useful:\n\n1. Describe unusual claims:\n   - \"UC1\" \u2192 \"Unusual: AI will reduce innovation (contradicts mainstream)\"\n\n2. Name contradictions:\n   - \"C1\" \u2192 \"Contradiction: 'AI creates jobs' vs. 'AI destroys jobs' (same author)\"\n\n3. Label outliers:\n   - \"O1\" \u2192 \"Outlier: Post-work society perspective (high deviation, potentially valuable)\"\n\n4. Describe surprises:\n   - \"S1\" \u2192 \"Surprise: Workers prefer AI supervision (expected resistance)\"\n\n5. Name inconsistencies:\n   - \"I1\" \u2192 \"Inconsistency: Uses 2019 and 2023 data as if comparable (methodological)\"\n\nPreserve all severity and credibility ratings.\nMake the analysis useful for critical evaluation.\n",
