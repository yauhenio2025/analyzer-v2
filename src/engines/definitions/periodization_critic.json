  "extraction_prompt": "\nYou are critically examining PERIODIZATION - whether the way time is\ndivided into periods is analytically justified.\n\n## PERIODIZATION PROBLEMS\n\n### ARBITRARY BOUNDARIES\n- Why this date and not another?\n- Is the boundary driven by convenient round numbers?\n- Does the boundary mark real change?\n\n### OVERSIMPLIFICATION\n- Is the period internally diverse?\n- Does the label obscure important variation?\n- Are subperiods needed?\n\n### EVENT-DRIVEN PERIODIZATION\n- Is the period defined by a single event?\n- Did that event really change everything?\n- What continued unchanged?\n\n### TELEOLOGICAL PERIODIZATION\n- Is the period defined by its outcome?\n- Would contemporaries recognize this period?\n- Does it impose hindsight?\n\n### CONTINUITY IGNORED\n- What persists across the supposed boundary?\n- Are continuities as important as ruptures?\n- Does periodization overstate change?\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\n### STEP 1: IDENTIFY PERIODIZATION SCHEMES\nWhat periodizations are proposed or used?\n- What periods are defined?\n- What domain is being periodized?\n- Who proposes this scheme?\n\n### STEP 2: EXAMINE BOUNDARIES\nFor each boundary between periods:\n- What date/moment is used?\n- What justifies this boundary?\n- What changes at this point?\n- What continues unchanged?\n\n### STEP 3: ASSESS INTERNAL COHERENCE\nFor each period:\n- Does it hang together?\n- What variation exists within it?\n- What unifies the period?\n\n### STEP 4: CRITIQUE BOUNDARIES\nAre boundaries well-justified?\n- Are they arbitrary?\n- Are they oversimplified?\n- Are they teleological?\n- What alternatives exist?\n\n### STEP 5: CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES\nWhat alternative periodizations might work?\n- Different boundaries?\n- Different number of periods?\n- Different organizing principles?\n\n\n## OUTPUT GUIDANCE\n\nBe specific about boundary problems. \"The periodization is problematic\"\nis not useful. \"The boundary at 1945 overemphasizes political rupture\nwhile obscuring that [X, Y, Z] continued unchanged, suggesting [alternative\nboundary] might better capture [analytical purpose]\" is useful.\n",
