# Analytical Stances — Shared Cognitive Postures for Multi-Pass Analysis
#
# These describe HOW the LLM should think in a given pass, not what
# shape the output takes. Output is always connected analytical prose.
#
# Each stance is a mode of thinking that recurs across many engines.
# The engine-specific dimensions guide WHAT to think about.
# The stance guides the COGNITIVE APPROACH.
#
# Think of these as a professor's instructions to a brilliant student:
# "First, survey everything you can find. Then, stress-test what you
# found. Finally, tell me what it all means."

stances:

  - key: discovery
    name: "Discovery"
    cognitive_mode: "divergent — maximize coverage"
    typical_position: early
    pairs_well_with: [inference, confrontation]
    stance: |
      Cast the widest possible net. Your job in this pass is to find
      everything that's there — be exhaustive, miss nothing, follow
      every thread even if it seems minor. Write about what you discover
      in connected analytical prose, thinking aloud as you go.

      Don't organize for a downstream consumer. Don't compress. Don't
      rank or filter yet. The richness of your observations IS the
      value — the next pass will build on everything you notice here,
      including the asides and the tentative connections that might
      turn out to be important.

      Treat the text as an archaeological site: your job is to uncover
      everything, tag it in place, and describe what you see. Later
      passes will interpret; this pass discovers.

      When you find something, stay with it. Describe it fully. Note
      what it reminds you of, what it connects to, what seems surprising
      about it. A discovery pass that lists items without dwelling on
      them has failed — you should be writing paragraphs, not bullets.

  - key: inference
    name: "Inference"
    cognitive_mode: "deductive — follow the logic wherever it leads"
    typical_position: early
    pairs_well_with: [discovery, confrontation, architecture]
    stance: |
      Trace what follows. Given what was discovered or stated, what
      are the logical consequences — the things that MUST be true if
      the stated positions hold? What is the author committed to
      without saying so?

      Follow every inferential chain as far as it goes. Some chains
      will lead to obvious conclusions the author simply left unstated.
      Others will lead somewhere surprising — to implications the author
      probably didn't intend, wouldn't welcome, or hasn't noticed.
      Both kinds matter.

      Write through each inference, showing your reasoning. Don't just
      state conclusions — trace the path. "If X is true, then Y follows
      because... and if Y, then Z because..." The inferential chain
      itself is the analytical product, not just the endpoint.

      Pay special attention to inferences the author seems to avoid —
      places where the logic points somewhere but the text veers away.
      These evasions are diagnostically valuable: they often mark the
      points where the argument is under the most pressure.

  - key: confrontation
    name: "Confrontation"
    cognitive_mode: "adversarial — maximize tension detection"
    typical_position: middle
    pairs_well_with: [discovery, inference, architecture]
    stance: |
      Now pit your findings against each other. Read the prose from
      prior passes and look for tensions, contradictions, uncomfortable
      implications, and things that don't quite fit together.

      Write about these tensions as a thinker working through them —
      don't just list them. What makes each tension interesting? Is it
      productive (generating new insight through its irresolution) or
      damaging (a genuine flaw in the argument)? Is it a direct
      contradiction, a pragmatic tension, or an inherited conflict
      from a cited source?

      How does the author navigate each tension? Do they acknowledge
      it and address it? Acknowledge it and bracket it ("this is
      beyond our scope")? Or fail to notice it entirely? The
      navigation strategy — or the absence of one — is as revealing
      as the tension itself.

      Be genuinely adversarial, not performatively so. The goal is
      not to destroy but to stress-test. A good confrontation pass
      finds the real fault lines — the places where the argument
      is genuinely under strain, not just places where you can
      quibble.

  - key: architecture
    name: "Architecture"
    cognitive_mode: "structural — map the load-bearing skeleton"
    typical_position: middle
    pairs_well_with: [discovery, confrontation, integration]
    stance: |
      Map the structural skeleton. What depends on what? What is
      foundational — assumed or asserted without derivation? What
      is derived — it follows from something else, and if that
      something else falls, this falls too?

      Think of the argument as a building. Some elements are
      load-bearing: remove them and everything above collapses.
      Others are decorative: remove them and the structure stands.
      Your job is to tell the difference.

      Trace the longest dependency chains. Where are the weakest
      links — the points where the chain is most likely to break?
      Where are the single points of failure — the one commitment,
      the one assumption, the one piece of evidence whose removal
      would bring down the most?

      Write about structure in connected prose, not as a list of
      dependencies. Describe the architecture the way an engineer
      describes a building: "This rests on that, which in turn
      rests on this foundation, and if we pull that foundation
      out, everything from here up comes down."

  - key: integration
    name: "Integration"
    cognitive_mode: "convergent — maximize insight density"
    typical_position: late
    pairs_well_with: [confrontation, architecture, reflection]
    stance: |
      Read everything from prior passes and synthesize. Not summarize —
      SYNTHESIZE. A summary repeats what was said more briefly. A
      synthesis reveals what no single prior pass could see: patterns
      that emerge only when you hold all the pieces together, narratives
      that connect findings across dimensions, insights that arise from
      the juxtaposition of things that seemed separate.

      Write the kind of connected analytical prose that a brilliant
      colleague would write after reading all your notes — someone
      who has absorbed everything and can now see the shape of the
      whole. What is the story here? What are the 3-5 things that
      matter most? What would surprise the author? What changes how
      we should read this text?

      Be specific and grounded. Every synthetic claim should trace
      back to specific findings from prior passes. Vague integrative
      statements ("the argument is complex and multifaceted") are
      worthless. Precise integrative statements ("the author's
      commitment to X creates an irresolvable tension with their
      reliance on Y, which means their conclusion Z is actually
      undermined by their own premises") are gold.

  - key: reflection
    name: "Reflection"
    cognitive_mode: "meta-cognitive — assess the assessment itself"
    typical_position: late
    pairs_well_with: [integration]
    stance: |
      Step back from the analysis and assess it. What confidence
      level attaches to each major finding? Where is the evidence
      strong and where is it circumstantial? What are the blind spots
      — things you couldn't see because of the method, the available
      texts, or the analytical framework?

      What questions remain unanswered? What would you investigate
      next if you had more time, more texts, or a different angle?
      What would change the picture most dramatically — what single
      new piece of evidence would most alter the conclusions?

      Be honest about uncertainty. The temptation in a final pass
      is to project false confidence, wrapping everything up neatly.
      Resist this. The most valuable thing a reflection pass can do
      is say clearly: "This finding is solid. This one is speculative.
      And this area we simply couldn't assess."

      If the analysis itself has biases — built into the method, the
      framework, or the analytical tradition — name them. Practicing
      what genealogy preaches: reflexive awareness of the conditions
      of your own knowledge production.

  - key: dialectical
    name: "Dialectics"
    cognitive_mode: "generative-contradictory — use tension as a creative force"
    typical_position: middle
    pairs_well_with: [confrontation, architecture, integration]
    stance: |
      Do not resolve the contradictions. Stay in them. Your task in
      this pass is not to find tensions (the confrontation pass did
      that) and not to synthesize them away (the integration pass
      will attempt that). Your task is to THINK THROUGH the
      contradictions — to inhabit them, let them exert pressure on
      each other, and articulate what new understanding emerges from
      the collision that neither side could generate alone.

      This is Hegel's insight: contradiction is not a sign of failure
      but the motor of thought. When a position, pushed to its logical
      extreme, turns into its opposite — that is not a refutation but
      a revelation. The concept was always already more than what its
      first articulation could express. Your job is to catch this
      movement in the act. Write about what happens when a commitment
      meets its own negation: not the empty negation that simply says
      "this is wrong," but the determinate negation that says precisely
      WHAT is wrong, and in doing so, points toward what is needed.

      Aufhebung — sublation — is the key operation. Each contradiction
      you work through should be simultaneously negated, preserved, and
      elevated. Negated: the contradiction in its raw form cannot stand.
      Preserved: both sides contain genuine insight that must survive
      into the next stage of understanding. Elevated: the new formulation
      stands on a higher level than either side could reach on its own.
      This is NOT compromise, not "both sides have a point," not splitting
      the difference. It is a genuinely new thought that could not have
      been predicted from either pole of the contradiction.

      Resist the two temptations that destroy dialectical thinking. The
      first is premature resolution — collapsing the tension into a
      comfortable synthesis before you have truly let the contradiction
      do its work. If your synthesis feels easy, you have not pushed
      hard enough. The second is abstract negation — simply cataloguing
      what is wrong without following the negation to its productive
      conclusion. Every "this fails because..." must continue into
      "...and that failure reveals that what is actually needed is..."
      The negative is equally positive: every determinate negation
      contains, in embryo, the specification of what would succeed.

      Work through contradictions one at a time. For each: state the
      thesis in its strongest form — not a straw version but the real
      thing, the position as its best advocate would articulate it.
      Then state what negates it — again, not an external objection
      but the internal pressure, the point where the position's own
      logic undermines itself. Then dwell in this collision. What
      does the thesis look like from the standpoint of its antithesis?
      What does the antithesis look like from the standpoint of the
      thesis? What do BOTH look like from the standpoint that can
      only emerge by holding them together? That third standpoint
      is your analytical product. It is the concrete universal — not
      an abstraction that ignores particulars, but a richer
      understanding that comprehends why the contradiction was
      necessary and what it was trying to articulate all along.

  - key: summary
    name: "Summary"
    stance_type: presentation
    cognitive_mode: "distillation — compress to headlines and key points"
    typical_position: any
    pairs_well_with: [narrative, diagnostic]
    ui_pattern: "stat cards, bullet lists, executive briefs"
    stance: |
      Distill the analytical output to its essence. Extract the 3-7
      most important findings, each as a single clear statement with
      a brief supporting explanation. Think executive summary: someone
      who reads only this should grasp what matters most.

      Prioritize ruthlessly. Not everything the analysis found is
      equally important. What would surprise the reader? What changes
      how they should think about this? What are the non-obvious
      insights that only emerge from deep analysis?

      Format for quick scanning: headlines first, supporting detail
      beneath. Use quantitative markers where available — counts,
      percentages, confidence levels. Each point should stand on its
      own while contributing to a coherent overall picture.

  - key: evidence
    name: "Evidence"
    stance_type: presentation
    cognitive_mode: "evidentiary — foreground sources, quotes, traceability"
    typical_position: any
    pairs_well_with: [comparison, diagnostic]
    ui_pattern: "quote cards with attribution, citation trails, evidence chains"
    stance: |
      Foreground the evidence. Every claim should trace back to a
      specific source: a direct quote, a paraphrase with page
      reference, a pattern observed across multiple texts.

      Present evidence in chains: Claim → Primary Evidence →
      Supporting Evidence → Counter-evidence (if any) → Assessment
      of evidential strength. The reader should be able to evaluate
      each claim independently by examining its evidential basis.

      Attribution is sacred. Distinguish between: direct textual
      evidence (the author said X), inferential evidence (the text
      implies Y because Z), and analytical evidence (pattern P
      emerged across works A, B, C). Different evidence types carry
      different epistemic weight — make this visible.

  - key: comparison
    name: "Comparison"
    stance_type: presentation
    cognitive_mode: "differential — side-by-side highlighting"
    typical_position: any
    pairs_well_with: [evidence, diagnostic]
    ui_pattern: "split panels, diff views, parallel timelines"
    stance: |
      Structure for side-by-side comparison. Whatever is being
      compared — works, ideas, time periods, methodological
      approaches — present them in parallel so differences and
      similarities become immediately visible.

      Use consistent dimensions across items being compared. If
      comparing works, use the same analytical categories for each.
      If comparing evolution over time, use the same vocabulary
      and methodology dimensions at each temporal point.

      Highlight both convergence (what's shared, what's stable) and
      divergence (what changed, what differs). Neither is inherently
      more interesting — the analytical value is in the pattern.
      Flag surprising similarities as well as surprising differences.

  - key: narrative
    name: "Narrative"
    stance_type: presentation
    cognitive_mode: "narrative — flowing prose with structure markers"
    typical_position: any
    pairs_well_with: [summary, evidence]
    ui_pattern: "formatted long-form with section anchors, reading time estimate"
    stance: |
      Present as flowing, connected prose organized by section
      anchors. This is the mode for when the analysis is best
      understood as a story — an unfolding argument, a historical
      trajectory, a process of intellectual development.

      Structure with clear sections and subsections, each with a
      descriptive heading that stands as a one-line summary. Within
      sections, write in connected paragraphs — not bullet points
      or fragments. The reader should be able to read straight
      through as a coherent text.

      Use transitional language that makes the logical structure
      visible: "This leads to...", "In contrast...", "Building on
      this foundation...", "The key tension emerges when...". The
      narrative should carry the reader through the analysis,
      building understanding cumulatively.

  - key: interactive
    name: "Interactive"
    stance_type: presentation
    cognitive_mode: "explorative — drill-down affordances"
    typical_position: any
    pairs_well_with: [summary, diagnostic]
    ui_pattern: "expandable cards, nested tabs, filter controls"
    stance: |
      Structure for interactive exploration. Present a compact
      overview that invites drill-down: each item or finding
      should have a visible summary and a hidden detail layer
      that expands on request.

      Organize hierarchically: top-level categories → individual
      items → item details → supporting evidence. At each level,
      provide enough information to decide whether to go deeper.
      The summary level should answer "what is this?" The detail
      level should answer "how does this work?" The evidence level
      should answer "why should I believe this?"

      Include filter and sort affordances: tag items by type,
      category, confidence, importance. Let the reader construct
      their own path through the material rather than imposing
      a single linear reading order.

  - key: diagnostic
    name: "Diagnostic"
    stance_type: presentation
    cognitive_mode: "meta-analytical — expose methodology, confidence, gaps"
    typical_position: any
    pairs_well_with: [evidence, comparison]
    ui_pattern: "confidence meters, coverage matrices, debug panels"
    stance: |
      Expose the analytical machinery. Show not just what was
      found but how confident the analysis is, what methodology
      was used, what was covered vs. what was missed, where the
      analysis is strongest and where it's weakest.

      Present confidence assessments per finding: high confidence
      (multiple independent evidence lines), medium confidence
      (suggestive but not definitive), low confidence (speculative
      or based on thin evidence). Make the epistemic status of
      each claim visible at a glance.

      Include coverage assessment: what dimensions were analyzed,
      what was excluded, what couldn't be assessed with available
      data. Show the boundary between what the analysis can say
      and what lies beyond its reach. This is the self-reflexive
      layer that prevents overclaiming.
