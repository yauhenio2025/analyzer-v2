# Analytical Stances — Shared Cognitive Postures for Multi-Pass Analysis
#
# These describe HOW the LLM should think in a given pass, not what
# shape the output takes. Output is always connected analytical prose.
#
# Each stance is a mode of thinking that recurs across many engines.
# The engine-specific dimensions guide WHAT to think about.
# The stance guides the COGNITIVE APPROACH.
#
# Think of these as a professor's instructions to a brilliant student:
# "First, survey everything you can find. Then, stress-test what you
# found. Finally, tell me what it all means."

stances:

  - key: discovery
    name: "Discovery"
    cognitive_mode: "divergent — maximize coverage"
    typical_position: early
    pairs_well_with: [inference, confrontation]
    stance: |
      Cast the widest possible net. Your job in this pass is to find
      everything that's there — be exhaustive, miss nothing, follow
      every thread even if it seems minor. Write about what you discover
      in connected analytical prose, thinking aloud as you go.

      Don't organize for a downstream consumer. Don't compress. Don't
      rank or filter yet. The richness of your observations IS the
      value — the next pass will build on everything you notice here,
      including the asides and the tentative connections that might
      turn out to be important.

      Treat the text as an archaeological site: your job is to uncover
      everything, tag it in place, and describe what you see. Later
      passes will interpret; this pass discovers.

      When you find something, stay with it. Describe it fully. Note
      what it reminds you of, what it connects to, what seems surprising
      about it. A discovery pass that lists items without dwelling on
      them has failed — you should be writing paragraphs, not bullets.

  - key: inference
    name: "Inference"
    cognitive_mode: "deductive — follow the logic wherever it leads"
    typical_position: early
    pairs_well_with: [discovery, confrontation, architecture]
    stance: |
      Trace what follows. Given what was discovered or stated, what
      are the logical consequences — the things that MUST be true if
      the stated positions hold? What is the author committed to
      without saying so?

      Follow every inferential chain as far as it goes. Some chains
      will lead to obvious conclusions the author simply left unstated.
      Others will lead somewhere surprising — to implications the author
      probably didn't intend, wouldn't welcome, or hasn't noticed.
      Both kinds matter.

      Write through each inference, showing your reasoning. Don't just
      state conclusions — trace the path. "If X is true, then Y follows
      because... and if Y, then Z because..." The inferential chain
      itself is the analytical product, not just the endpoint.

      Pay special attention to inferences the author seems to avoid —
      places where the logic points somewhere but the text veers away.
      These evasions are diagnostically valuable: they often mark the
      points where the argument is under the most pressure.

  - key: confrontation
    name: "Confrontation"
    cognitive_mode: "adversarial — maximize tension detection"
    typical_position: middle
    pairs_well_with: [discovery, inference, architecture]
    stance: |
      Now pit your findings against each other. Read the prose from
      prior passes and look for tensions, contradictions, uncomfortable
      implications, and things that don't quite fit together.

      Write about these tensions as a thinker working through them —
      don't just list them. What makes each tension interesting? Is it
      productive (generating new insight through its irresolution) or
      damaging (a genuine flaw in the argument)? Is it a direct
      contradiction, a pragmatic tension, or an inherited conflict
      from a cited source?

      How does the author navigate each tension? Do they acknowledge
      it and address it? Acknowledge it and bracket it ("this is
      beyond our scope")? Or fail to notice it entirely? The
      navigation strategy — or the absence of one — is as revealing
      as the tension itself.

      Be genuinely adversarial, not performatively so. The goal is
      not to destroy but to stress-test. A good confrontation pass
      finds the real fault lines — the places where the argument
      is genuinely under strain, not just places where you can
      quibble.

  - key: architecture
    name: "Architecture"
    cognitive_mode: "structural — map the load-bearing skeleton"
    typical_position: middle
    pairs_well_with: [discovery, confrontation, integration]
    stance: |
      Map the structural skeleton. What depends on what? What is
      foundational — assumed or asserted without derivation? What
      is derived — it follows from something else, and if that
      something else falls, this falls too?

      Think of the argument as a building. Some elements are
      load-bearing: remove them and everything above collapses.
      Others are decorative: remove them and the structure stands.
      Your job is to tell the difference.

      Trace the longest dependency chains. Where are the weakest
      links — the points where the chain is most likely to break?
      Where are the single points of failure — the one commitment,
      the one assumption, the one piece of evidence whose removal
      would bring down the most?

      Write about structure in connected prose, not as a list of
      dependencies. Describe the architecture the way an engineer
      describes a building: "This rests on that, which in turn
      rests on this foundation, and if we pull that foundation
      out, everything from here up comes down."

  - key: integration
    name: "Integration"
    cognitive_mode: "convergent — maximize insight density"
    typical_position: late
    pairs_well_with: [confrontation, architecture, reflection]
    stance: |
      Read everything from prior passes and synthesize. Not summarize —
      SYNTHESIZE. A summary repeats what was said more briefly. A
      synthesis reveals what no single prior pass could see: patterns
      that emerge only when you hold all the pieces together, narratives
      that connect findings across dimensions, insights that arise from
      the juxtaposition of things that seemed separate.

      Write the kind of connected analytical prose that a brilliant
      colleague would write after reading all your notes — someone
      who has absorbed everything and can now see the shape of the
      whole. What is the story here? What are the 3-5 things that
      matter most? What would surprise the author? What changes how
      we should read this text?

      Be specific and grounded. Every synthetic claim should trace
      back to specific findings from prior passes. Vague integrative
      statements ("the argument is complex and multifaceted") are
      worthless. Precise integrative statements ("the author's
      commitment to X creates an irresolvable tension with their
      reliance on Y, which means their conclusion Z is actually
      undermined by their own premises") are gold.

  - key: reflection
    name: "Reflection"
    cognitive_mode: "meta-cognitive — assess the assessment itself"
    typical_position: late
    pairs_well_with: [integration]
    stance: |
      Step back from the analysis and assess it. What confidence
      level attaches to each major finding? Where is the evidence
      strong and where is it circumstantial? What are the blind spots
      — things you couldn't see because of the method, the available
      texts, or the analytical framework?

      What questions remain unanswered? What would you investigate
      next if you had more time, more texts, or a different angle?
      What would change the picture most dramatically — what single
      new piece of evidence would most alter the conclusions?

      Be honest about uncertainty. The temptation in a final pass
      is to project false confidence, wrapping everything up neatly.
      Resist this. The most valuable thing a reflection pass can do
      is say clearly: "This finding is solid. This one is speculative.
      And this area we simply couldn't assess."

      If the analysis itself has biases — built into the method, the
      framework, or the analytical tradition — name them. Practicing
      what genealogy preaches: reflexive awareness of the conditions
      of your own knowledge production.
