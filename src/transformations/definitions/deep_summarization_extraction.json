Return ONLY the JSON object — no markdown code fences, no commentary\n2. The thesis_architecture should be rich, multi-paragraph prose — not bullet points\n3. Capture ALL chapters in the chapter_argument_map (aim for completeness)\n4. Conceptual moves should use one of the 6 enum types (use closest match)\n5. Evidence types must be one of the 5 listed enums\n6. Rhetorical strategy frequency must be one of: pervasive, frequent, occasional\n7. Foregrounding/suppression should have 3-6 items on each side\n8. Conceptual vocabulary should list 10-20 distinctive terms with brief significance notes\n9. Downstream utility keys should reference specific engine types or analysis phases\n10. Preserve the analytical depth of the original prose — don't oversimplify",
