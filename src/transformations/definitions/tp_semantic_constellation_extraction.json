Return ONLY JSON \u2014 no markdown fences, no commentary\n2. Extract 20-40 core concepts (be thorough \u2014 the source has ~20k words across 4 passes)\n3. Identify 6-12 concept clusters that group related terms meaningfully\n4. Load-bearing terms: 5-10 terms that carry disproportionate analytical weight\n5. Boundary tensions: 4-8 tensions, each with genuine dialectical analysis\n6. semantic_architecture should be a genuine structural analysis, not a list\n7. vocabulary_signature should identify what's distinctive about this author specifically\n8. Preserve the original terminology faithfully\n9. Synthesize across ALL passes \u2014 don't privilege the last pass over earlier ones\n10. Mark concepts as contested=true when the author redefines or challenges standard usage",
