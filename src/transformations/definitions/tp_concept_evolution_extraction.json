Semantic clusters: 4-8 clusters showing how concepts group historically\n6. Foundational patterns: 3-8 deep structural patterns (e.g., 'secularization of theological concepts')\n7. Dimensional comparisons should use Koselleckian categories: temporalization, democratization, ideologization, politicization\n8.
