  "description": "Deep profiling of complex prior/background works before genealogical scanning. Runs deep summarization (thesis architecture, evidence patterns, conceptual vocabulary) followed by narrative structure analysis (emplotment, voice, temporality). A lighter version of deep_text_profiling — no chapter_role_analyzer since chapter structure of prior works matters less than content. Used when a prior work is complex enough to warrant deep summarization before genealogical scanning can be productive.",
