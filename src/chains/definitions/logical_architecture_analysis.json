Use dialectical_structure for texts with thesis-antithesis dynamics or Hegelian/Marxist framing. Use counterfactual_analyzer for texts heavy on causal/what-if reasoning. Use modal_reasoning_analyzer for texts making strong possibility/necessity claims. Use comparative_reasoning_analyzer for analogy-heavy or typology-driven texts. Use epistemological_method_detector for methodologically self-conscious texts. Use theory_construction_analyzer for texts explicitly building theoretical frameworks. Use specialized_reasoning_classifier for texts employing formal reasoning patterns (Bayesian, game-theoretic, normative). Use structural_pattern_detector for texts where the physical organization serves argumentative purposes. Use concept_centrality_mapper for extended works where argument hierarchy and long-distance connections matter.",
