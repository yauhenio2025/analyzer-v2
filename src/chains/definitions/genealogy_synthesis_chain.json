  "description": "Multi-stage synthesis chain covering cross-work idea synthesis, argumentative function analysis, evolution tactics detection, and conditions of possibility analysis. Runs four engines in sequence: (1) concept synthesis merges traces from multiple prior works into unified evolution narratives with convergence/divergence detection; (2) argumentative function analysis maps how concepts serve the author's argument; (3) evolution tactics detector identifies 10 intellectual self-management tactics (conceptual recycling, silent revision, strategic escalation, etc.); (4) conditions of possibility analyzer performs Foucauldian/Cambridge School analysis of intellectual path-dependence. Each engine builds on the previous engine's output.",
