## CONCRETIZATION TASKS

### 1. NAME EVERYTHING VIVIDLY

Transform abstract IDs into memorable, descriptive names.

{% if concretization.id_examples %}
**Examples:**
{% for example in concretization.id_examples %}
- `{{ example.from }}` → "{{ example.to }}"
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
**Examples:**
- `C1` → "The 'Humans Stay in Charge' commitment"
- `X1` → "The 'Can't Have Both' choice: automation vs. accountability"
- `I1` → "The AI Autonomy Thesis"
- `P1` → "The Techno-Optimist Bundle"
{% endif %}

{% if concretization.naming_guidance %}
**Naming Guidance:**
{{ concretization.naming_guidance }}
{% else %}
**Naming Principles:**
- **Evocative**: Names should capture the essence in 3-7 words
- **Memorable**: Someone should remember the name after reading once
- **Accurate**: The name should genuinely represent the content
- **Audience-appropriate**: Match the vocabulary to {{ audience }} level
{% endif %}

---

### 2. MAKE STAKES VISCERAL

Transform analytical statements into impactful language.

**Before (analytical):**
> "This entails downstream commitment to Q"

**After (visceral):**
> "Accept this, and you're stuck defending Q whether you meant to or not"

---

### 3. SURFACE THE HIDDEN GAME

Don't just describe what IS. Reveal what MATTERS.

**Before:**
> "The author incurs normative commitments"

**After:**
> "By saying this, the author is putting themselves on the hook for..."

{% if concretization.recommended_table_types %}
## TABLE OUTPUT GUIDANCE

When rendering as tables, use these formats:

{% for table_type in concretization.recommended_table_types %}
### {{ table_type | replace('_', ' ') | title }}
Optimize data structure for {{ table_type | replace('_', ' ') }} visualization.

{% endfor %}

**Table Language Rules:**
- Column headers should be QUESTIONS or PLAIN PHRASES
  - GOOD: "What You Get", "The Catch", "Who Says So"
  - BAD: "Commitment", "Entitlement", "Inference"
- Cell content should be PUNCHY and SCANNABLE
- Use status indicators that feel natural: "Locked in", "Usually", "Loosely"
{% endif %}

---

{% if concretization.recommended_visual_patterns %}
## VISUAL OUTPUT GUIDANCE

When rendering as graphs/diagrams, optimize for:

{% for pattern in concretization.recommended_visual_patterns %}
- **{{ pattern | replace('_', ' ') | title }}**: Structure data for this visualization pattern
{% endfor %}

**Visual Labeling Rules:**
- Node labels: 2-5 words, evocative
- Edge labels: relationship type, clear
- Cluster names: memorable themes
{% endif %}

---

## THE TRANSLATION TEST

Before finalizing, read your output aloud. Would a smart {{ audience }} without specialized training:

1. **Understand every word?** (no googling required)
2. **See something they didn't see before?** (real insight)
3. **Know what's at stake?** (visceral understanding)
4. **Be able to explain it to someone else?** (transferable)

If not → translate further.

---

## PRESERVE THE DEPTH

**Don't dumb it down - TRANSLATE it.**

The insights should be just as sophisticated, just expressed in words everyone knows.

- A specialist reading this should think: "They really understand this - beautifully translated."
- A non-specialist should think: "I never saw it this way before, but now it seems obvious."

---

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

1. **All IDs replaced** with concrete, memorable names
2. **All jargon translated** appropriate to {{ audience }} level
3. **All relationships preserved** in accessible language
4. **All structural data intact** for rendering
5. **Vivid, punchy language** throughout

The analysis is complete. Your job is to make it accessible without losing any depth.
