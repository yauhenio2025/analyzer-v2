## SYNTHESIS TASK

You have {{ curation.item_type }} extractions from multiple documents.
Now synthesize them into a unified picture.

### ANALYZING MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS AS A DISCOURSE

When you have multiple documents, you're not just analyzing them separately -
you're mapping a CONVERSATION across texts, authors, and time.

Look for:
- Where one author **RESPONDS** to another (implicitly or explicitly)
- **SHARED** {{ curation.item_type_plural }} everyone seems to accept
- **CONTESTED** {{ curation.item_type_plural }} where authors diverge
- What's being **ASSUMED** without argument (common ground)
- What's being **FOUGHT** over (active disputes)

## CONSOLIDATION RULES

{% if curation.consolidation_rules %}
{% for rule in curation.consolidation_rules %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ rule }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
1. **DEDUPLICATE**: Merge equivalent {{ curation.item_type_plural }} that appear across articles
   - Same core content + similar supporting evidence = merge
   - Keep the best articulation from each source

2. **PRESERVE PROVENANCE**: Track which document(s) each item came from
   - Never lose source attribution
   - Note when multiple sources support the same item

3. **IDENTIFY CHAINS**: Find where one {{ curation.item_type }}'s conclusion feeds into another
   - Create chain_ids and sequence items logically
   - Note the terminal points of each chain

4. **MAP RELATIONSHIPS**: Build the relationship graph
   - What supports what?
   - What conflicts with what?
   - What depends on what?
{% endif %}

{% if curation.cross_doc_patterns %}
## CROSS-DOCUMENT PATTERNS TO IDENTIFY

{% for pattern in curation.cross_doc_patterns %}
- **{{ pattern | replace('_', ' ') | title }}**: Map where this appears across documents
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

---

## SYNTHESIS OUTPUTS

{% if curation.synthesis_outputs %}
Build these specific outputs:

{% for output in curation.synthesis_outputs %}
### {{ loop.index }}. {{ output | replace('_', ' ') | title }}
Create a comprehensive {{ output | replace('_', ' ') }} from the consolidated data.

{% endfor %}
{% else %}
### 1. Consolidated Item List
All deduplicated {{ curation.item_type_plural }} with source tracking.

### 2. Relationship Map
How {{ curation.item_type_plural }} connect across the collection.

### 3. Cross-Document Dynamics
- **Shared Ground**: {{ curation.item_type_plural | title }} everyone accepts
- **Contested Territory**: {{ curation.item_type_plural | title }} under dispute
- **Fault Lines**: Fundamental disagreements

### 4. Author/Source Positions
Who takes what position on key {{ curation.item_type_plural }}.

## ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS

{{ curation.special_instructions }}

{% endif %}

## QUALITY CHECKS

Before finalizing:

1. **No orphans**: Every {{ curation.item_type }} should have at least one relationship
2. **No duplicates**: Same content shouldn't appear twice
3. **Source tracking**: Every item traces back to source document(s)
4. **Relationship reciprocity**: If A relates to B, B should relate to A
5. **Audience calibration**: Language matches {{ audience }} expectations

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Produce a comprehensive synthesis that:
- Maintains all individual extractions (consolidated)
- Adds cross-document analysis
- Builds the relationship graph
- Identifies patterns invisible in single-document analysis

The goal is a MAP that reveals the landscape across all documents.
