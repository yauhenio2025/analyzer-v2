    "title": "Techno-Feudalism: What Killed Capitalism",
    "author": "Yanis Varoufakis",
    "year": 2023,
    "description": "Argues that capitalism has mutated into techno-feudalism through the rise of cloud capital — platform-based algorithmic systems that have replaced market dynamics with feudal rent extraction. Central to the argument is that Big Tech platforms like Amazon and Meta are not traditional capitalist enterprises but cloud fiefs that extract rent rather than profit."

  "research_question": "How did Varoufakis's Marxist intellectual formation shape the conceptual vocabulary and argumentative architecture of Techno-Feudalism?",
  "strategy_summary": "The analytical strategy for Yanis Varoufakis's corpus centers on tracking his highly distinct conceptual vocabulary ('technofeudalism', 'cloud capital', 'global minotaur') across a radically diverse set of genres (academic monograph, memoir, speculative fiction, popular economics). Because Varoufakis frequently embeds dense political economy within narrative structures, the pipeline initiates with Phase 0.5 (Deep Text Profiling) using a large-context model to capture both argumentative architecture and narrative emplotment in the target work. Phase 1.0 expands the baseline target profiling by explicitly appending economic and rhetorical supplementary chains, preparing a rich, 150k-character distilled target profile.\n\nGiven the massive scale of the prior works (e.g., the 1.3M-character 'Adults in the Room'), a dedicated Phase 1.8 (Prior Work Profiling) is introduced. This phase ensures each massive book is structurally summarized and its narrative arcs mapped before the deep genealogical scanning in Phase 2.0. By using Gemini for text profiling and Opus for the deep comparative synthesis, the pipeline balances massive context ingestion with rigorous, dialectical concept-tracking. The final phases synthesize how Varoufakis recycles, mutates, and strategically escalates his economic theories across audiences and genres.",
