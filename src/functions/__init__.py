"""Functions module - LLM-powered function definitions.

Functions are the primary activity unit in decision support systems.
Each function represents an LLM-powered capability with:
- Prompt templates (system + user prompts)
- Model configuration (which model, thinking budget, etc.)
- I/O contract (input/output schemas)
- Implementation locations (links to source code across projects)
- DAG relationships (what feeds into what)
