I need to create a comprehensive advanced engine definition for a Counterfactual Analyzer based on Lewis-Stalnaker possible worlds semantics and historical counterfactual methodology. Let me carefully plan this out.

## Key Theorists & Concepts to Incorporate:

**David Lewis:**
- Possible worlds semantics
- Similarity metrics for counterfactuals
- Closest possible world
- Backtracking vs non-backtracking counterfactuals
- Counterfactual dependence
- Causation analysis

**Richard Ned Lebow:**
- Historical counterfactual methodology
- Contingency in history
- Plausibility criteria

**Philip Tetlock:**
- Counterfactual thought experiments
- Expert judgment calibration

**Max Weber:**
- Objective possibility
- Adequate causation

## Required Concepts (must appear):
- minimal rewrite principle
- miracle vs non-miracle changes
- second-order counterfactuals (counterfactuals of counterfactuals)
- cotenability constraints
- historical plausibility criteria
- possible worlds
- closest possible world
- similarity ordering
- backtracking counterfactuals
- non-backtracking counterfactuals
- counterfactual dependence
- causal chains in counterfactuals
- overdetermination
- preemption
- objective possibility
- adequate causation
- nomological possibility
- historical contingency vs necessity

## Entity Types I'll Need (15+ required):

1. **counterfactual_claims** (CF{N}) - The main counterfactual statements being analyzed
2. **antecedent_conditions** (ANT{N}) - The "if" part of counterfactuals
3. **consequent_claims** (CON{N}) - The "then" part of counterfactuals
4. **possible_worlds** (PW{N}) - The possible worlds being invoked
5. **similarity_orderings** (SIM{N}) - How worlds are ranked by similarity


6. **minimal_rewrites** (MR{N}) - Analysis of minimal rewrite principle
7. **miracle_assessments** (MIR{N}) - Miracle vs non-miracle changes
8. **causal_chains** (CC{N}) - Causal connections in counterfactuals
9. **cotenability_constraints** (COT{N}) - What must be held fixed
10. **backtracking_analyses** (BT{N}) - Backtracking vs non-backtracking
11. **historical_plausibility** (HP{N}) - Plausibility assessments
12. **contingency_assessments** (CT{N}) - Historical contingency vs necessity evaluations
13. **counterfactual_dependence** (CD{N}) - Dependence relations between events
14. **causal_overdetermination** (OD{N}) - Multiple sufficient causes
15. **preemption_cases** (PREM{N}) - Preemption scenarios
16. **objective_possibility** (OP{N}) - Weberian objective possibility assessments
17. **adequate_causation** (AC{N}) - Weberian adequate causation analysis

I also need to establish the core semantic framework and define how these entities interact within the counterfactual analysis engine. I'm organizing the analytical framework into a structured JSON schema that captures the full counterfactual analysis pipeline. The engine encompasses multiple assessment layers—from basic causal chains through complex overdetermination and preemption scenarios, up to second-order counterfactuals and Weber's objective possibility standard. Each component gets a unique identifier and assessment category. Now I need to flesh out the canonical schema definition and establish the contextual parameters that will guide how this analysis engine operates across different research questions.
