I need to create a comprehensive advanced engine definition for authenticity forensics, deeply grounded in the RAND Firehose Model and Epistemic Vigilance Theory. Let me carefully design this engine with all the required components.

## Key Theorists and Concepts to Include:
1. **Christopher Paul & Miriam Matthews**: Firehose of Falsehood (high-volume, rapid, continuous, multichannel, lack of commitment to objective reality)
2. **Dan Sperber & Hugo Mercier**: Epistemic vigilance, argumentative theory of reasoning, source heuristics, content heuristics
3. **Gordon Pennycook**: Bullshit receptivity, lazy reasoning, analytic thinking, illusory truth effect
4. **Kate Starbird**: Coordinated inauthentic behavior, participatory disinformation, alternative media ecosystem, narrative laundering

## Key Concepts that MUST appear:
- source manipulation vs content manipulation
- coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB)
- epistemic vigilance cues
- firehose tactics (volume, rapid, continuous, multichannel)
- prebunking vs debunking
- inoculation theory
- credibility signals
- sockpuppets and bot networks
- astroturfing
- narrative laundering
- information laundering
- source heuristics
- content heuristics
- motivated reasoning
- illusory truth effect
- repetition-induced belief
- source-content decoupling
- adversarial narratives
- strategic ambiguity

## Entity Types I need to design (15+ interconnected):

1. **Deceptive Claims (DC{N})** - The actual false/misleading claims being made
2. **Source Actors (SA{N})** - Who is making claims (individuals, organizations, bots, sockpuppets)
3. **Coordination Networks (CN{N})** - Coordinated inauthentic behavior patterns
4. **Manipulation Tactics (MT{N})** - The specific techniques used


5. **Narrative Threads (NT{N})** - Larger story arcs being promoted across channels
6. **Credibility Signals (CS{N})** - Authentic or fabricated markers of trustworthiness
7. **Epistemic Vulnerabilities (EV{N})** - Cognitive gaps and susceptibilities being targeted
8. **Information Laundering Chains (ILC{N})** - Pathways through which claims gain legitimacy by passing through ostensibly credible intermediaries
9. **Amplification Patterns (AP{N})** - Distribution mechanisms and resonance effects across networks
10. **Inoculation Targets (IT{N})** - Audiences and beliefs that prebunking interventions could strengthen
11. **Verification Checkpoints (VC{N})** - Critical junctures where claims can be evaluated against evidence

, plus where skepticism should intensify
12. **Source-Content Pairings (SCP{N})** - How source reputation influences content reception and vice versa
13. **Repetition Clusters (RC{N})** - Recurring messaging patterns that exploit the illusory truth effect
14. **Strategic Ambiguities (SAM{N})** - Intentionally vague framing that allows multiple interpretations
15. **Counter-Narrative Opportunities (CNO{N})** - Intervention points where alternative framings could gain traction
16. **Bot Network Signatures (BNS{N})** - Automated behavior patterns and technical fingerprints
17. **Astroturfing Campaigns (AC{N})** - Coordinated inauthentic behavior masquerading as organic movements
18. **Motivated Reasoning Hooks (MRH{N})** - Psychological vulnerabilities and identity-based biases being leveraged

Now I'm structuring this into a formal schema with the engine key, metadata about the reasoning domain, and extraction methodology. The core extraction steps involve applying established frameworks: Paul & Matthews' firehose detection criteria (volume, velocity, continuity, multichannel distribution), and Sperber & Mercier's epistemic vigilance model to identify which source and content heuristics are being triggered to bypass critical evaluation.

I'm also incorporating Pennycook's work on cognitive exploitation—examining whether System 1 thinking is being leveraged and which bullshit receptivity factors are being targeted. Starbird's coordination detection methods help identify temporal synchronization and narrative convergence across supposedly independent sources, while information laundering traces track how claims move from fringe origins through legitimizing intermediaries into mainstream channels. Finally, I'm mapping prebunking opportunities by anticipating predictable attack vectors.
