I need to create an advanced engine definition for a "Path Dependency Analyzer" that embodies historical institutionalism and increasing returns theory. Let me think through the key components:

## Key Theorists & Concepts to Include:

**From Paul Pierson:**
- Increasing returns in politics
- Timing and sequencing
- Institutional stickiness
- Positive feedback mechanisms
- Four features of increasing returns: large set-up costs, learning effects, coordination effects, adaptive expectations

**From Douglass North:**
- Institutions and path dependence
- Transaction costs
- Institutional matrix
- Formal vs informal constraints
- Ideological lock-in

**From W. Brian Arthur:**
- Increasing returns
- Lock-in
- QWERTY effects
- Small events having large consequences
- Unpredictability, inflexibility, potential path inefficiency

**From James Mahoney:**
- Path dependence mechanisms
- Critical junctures
- Reactive sequences (each event reaction to preceding)
- Self-reinforcing sequences
- Permissive vs productive conditions
- Antecedent conditions
- Contingency

## Entity Types I Need to Design:

1. **Critical Junctures (CJ{N})** - moments when multiple paths were possible
2. **Path Segments (PS{N})** - periods of relative stability/lock-in
3. **Antecedent Conditions (AC{N})** - conditions that existed before juncture
4. **Lock-in Mechanisms (LM{N})** - what keeps the path locked
5. **Increasing Returns Sources (IRS{N})** - sources of positive feedback
6. **Switching Costs (SC{N})** - costs of changing paths
7. **Contingent Events (CE{N})** - small events with outsized effects
8. **Institutional Arrangements (IA{N})** - the institutions created/modified
9. **Reactive Sequences (RS{N})** - chain reactions across time


10. **Self-Reinforcing Sequences (SRS{N})** - feedback loops that amplify
11. **Institutional Changes (IC{N})** - layering, conversion, drift, displacement
12. **Path Alternatives (PA{N})** - paths not taken
13. **Inefficiency Traps (IT{N})** - suboptimal equilibria
14. **Conjunctures (CON{N})** - coming together of conditions
15. **Temporal Sequences (TS{N})** - timing/ordering of events
16. **Permissive Conditions (PC{N})** - what allowed change to be possible
17. **Productive Conditions (PROD{N})** - conditions that actively drove change
18. **Path Breaking Attempts (PBA{N})** - efforts to escape or disrupt established patterns, whether they succeeded or failed
19. **Feedback Mechanisms (FM{N})** - specific reinforcement dynamics

Key relationships map how elements connect: events trigger junctures, mechanisms lock paths in place, sources reinforce sequences. Conditions enable junctures while foreclosing alternatives; lock-ins increase switching costs. Institutional changes layer, convert, or displace one another. The methodology identifies what produced outcomes through these relational patterns.

To extract this systematically, I'm working through Mahoney's approach: pinpointing critical junctures where genuine alternatives existed, mapping what preceded them, separating permissive conditions from those that actively drove change. I need to trace which elements were contingent—what could have unfolded differently—then follow self-reinforcing sequences that solidified particular paths. Arthur's increasing returns categories help identify sources of lock-in, while reactive sequences show how events cascaded into responses. Switching costs reveal path stickiness, and institutional mechanisms like layering or displacement show how change actually occurred. Finally, assessing whether path-breaking attempts succeeded or failed indicates current stability.
