Applies Dennett's Rapoport Rules, Davidson's principle of charity, and Gadamer's hermeneutic circle to reconstruct arguments at their strongest before critique. Reveals implicit premises, identifies points of agreement, traces what can be learned from opposing views, and distinguishes legitimate criticism from strawmanning.

        "STEP 1: IDENTIFY ARGUMENTS TO RECONSTRUCT - Locate all substantive arguments in the text. For each, note the apparent conclusion, explicit premises, and rhetorical quality. Flag arguments that are vulnerable to strawmanning\u2014those that are rough, fragmentary, or easily caricatured.",
        "STEP 2: APPLY DAVIDSON'S PRINCIPLE OF CHARITY - For each argument, ask: 'What interpretation maximizes the truth of the speaker's beliefs and the rationality of their reasoning?' Assume the author is mostly right about most things. If a reading makes them seem foolish, you've probably misread them.",
        "STEP 3: APPLY THE PRINCIPLE OF HUMANITY - Beyond mere charity, ask: 'What makes this argument humanly intelligible?' What experiences, concerns, or values would make someone hold this view? Davidson's triangulation: locate the shared world that makes the disagreement meaningful.",
        "STEP 4: SURFACE IMPLICIT PREMISES - Identify what must be true (but wasn't said) for the argument to work. Use the principle: 'If the argument seems invalid, add the premise that would make it valid, then evaluate that premise.' Make the enthymeme explicit.",
        "STEP 5: MAP BACKGROUND ASSUMPTIONS (GADAMER'S VORURTEIL) - Identify the deeper worldview assumptions\u2014the 'prejudices' in Gadamer's rehabilitated sense\u2014that enable the argument. These aren't flaws but conditions of understanding. What must be taken for granted for the argument to even be intelligible?",
        "STEP 6: ENTER THE HERMENEUTIC CIRCLE - Read parts through the whole and the whole through the parts. Iterate: Does this premise make sense given the overall argument? Does the overall argument make sense given this premise? Continue until interpretation stabilizes or productive tensions emerge.",
        "STEP 7: ANALYZE HORIZONS (GADAMER'S HORIZONTVERSCHMELZUNG) - Identify the author's interpretive horizon (their situation, assumptions, what's visible to them) and your own. Where are they distant? Where might they fuse? What would a fusion of horizons produce?",
        "STEP 8: EXECUTE RAPOPORT RULE 1 - Restate the argument so clearly, vividly, and fairly that the author would say 'Thanks, I wish I'd thought of putting it that way.' This is the steelmanned reconstruction. Test: Would the author recognize and endorse this version?",
        "STEP 9: EXECUTE RAPOPORT RULE 2 - List all points of agreement, especially non-obvious ones. What do you share with this argument? Common values? Shared diagnoses? Methodological commitments? This is not politeness\u2014it's epistemic honesty about common ground.",
        "STEP 10: EXECUTE RAPOPORT RULE 3 - State what you have genuinely learned from this argument. What did it show you that you hadn't seen? What does it understand that you didn't? Epistemic humility requires this: every serious position grasps something real.",
        "STEP 11: IDENTIFY STRENGTHENING MOVES - Document how you strengthened the argument: narrowed scope to defensible claims, added implicit evidence, resolved ambiguities charitably, preempted obvious objections. Each move should be explicit and justified.",
        "STEP 12: CONSTRUCT THE WEAKEST FORM (FOR CONTRAST) - Create the strawman version: the argument at its worst, most easily refuted. This isn't your interpretation\u2014it's what an uncharitable critic would attack. The contrast shows how much charitable reconstruction matters.",
        "STEP 13: EXECUTE RAPOPORT RULE 4 - NOW, and only now, identify legitimate critiques. These are problems that survive charitable reconstruction\u2014weaknesses in the argument at its best, not its worst. Critique the steelman, not the strawman.",
        "STEP 14: ASSESS COHERENCE (DAVIDSON) - For each reconstruction, evaluate: internal logical consistency, fit with known facts, theoretical unity, pragmatic coherence with practices. Is this the maximally coherent reading? Are there alternative maximally coherent readings?",
        "STEP 15: BUILD THE RELATIONSHIP GRAPH - Map how arguments connect: which share premises, which are in tension, where fusion points exist, which critiques apply to multiple arguments. Identify clusters of related arguments and the agreements that might bridge opposing positions."

The methodology proceeds in strict sequence: first reconstruct charitably, then identify agreements, then acknowledge learnings, and only then critique.
