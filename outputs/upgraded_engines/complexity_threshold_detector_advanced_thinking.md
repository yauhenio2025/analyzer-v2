Let me carefully analyze what's being asked and create a comprehensive advanced engine definition for the Complexity Threshold Detector.

The methodology is based on:
1. Dave Snowden's Cynefin framework
2. Stuart Kauffman's edge of chaos and self-organization
3. John Holland's complex adaptive systems
4. W. Brian Arthur's complexity economics

Key concepts I MUST include:
- Cynefin domains (clear, complicated, complex, chaotic, confused)
- probe-sense-respond vs sense-analyze-respond
- emergence and self-organization
- edge of chaos
- phase transitions
- requisite variety (Ashby's law)
- fitness landscapes
- attractors and basins of attraction
- bifurcation points
- sensitive dependence on initial conditions
- power laws and scale-free networks
- adaptive agents
- co-evolution
- positive feedback
- path dependence
- lock-in
- irreducible uncertainty
- distributed intelligence
- non-linearity

I need to create an engine with:
1. 15+ entity types with rich fields
2. Explicit relationship fields connecting entities
3. ID format conventions for each entity type
4. A relationship_graph section
5. A meta section with counts and highlights
6. Detailed methodology-specific extraction_steps

Let me design the entity types:

1. **domain_assessments** - Assessment of which Cynefin domain something falls into
   - ID format: DA{N}
   
2. **threshold_crossings** - When systems cross from one domain to another
   - ID format: TX{N}

3. **complexity_indicators** - Observable signs of complexity level
   - ID format: CI{N}

4. **adaptive_agents** - Agents in the system that adapt
   - ID format: AG{N}

5. **fitness_landscapes** - The possibility space for adaptation
   - ID format: FL{N}

6. **attractors** - States the system tends toward
   - ID format: ATT{N}

7. **bifurcation_points** - Points where small changes cause large effects
   - ID format: BIF{N}

8. **emergence_patterns** - Patterns that emerge from agent interactions
   - ID format: EM{N}

9. **feedback_mechanisms** - Positive and negative feedback
   - ID format: FM{N}

10. **path_dependencies** - Historical choices that constrain current options
    - ID format: PD{N}

11. **lock_ins** - Locked-in states due to increasing returns
    - ID format: LK{N}

12. **phase_transitions** - Shifts in system behavior at critical thresholds
    - ID format: PT{N}

13. **response_strategies** - Tailored approaches based on domain complexity
    - ID format: RS{N}

14. **method_mismatches** - Applying inappropriate tools to different complexity levels
    - ID format: MM{N}

15. **variety_assessments** - Analyzing requisite variety within systems
    - ID format: VA{N}

16. **scale_free_structures** - Network topologies exhibiting power law distributions
    - ID format: SF{N}

17. **sensitive_dependencies** - Initial conditions that significantly influence outcomes
    - ID format: SD{N}

18. **co_evolutionary_dynamics** - Mutual adaptation among interacting agents
    - ID format: CE{N}

19. **constraints** - Structures that both enable and limit behavior
    - ID format: CON{N}

20. **pro

_bes** - Safe-to-fail experiments for testing in uncertain domains
    - ID format: PRB{N}

The engine combines Cynefin framework analysis with Santa Fe complexity science to identify where systems sit across domains and detect when they're crossing thresholds. It maps fitness landscapes, traces how agents co-evolve, and flags situations where linear methods are being applied to inherently non-linear problems.
