Let me carefully analyze the task and create a comprehensive advanced engine definition for the motte-bailey detector.

The methodology requirements specify:
1. Primary theorists: Nicholas Shackel, Frans van Eemeren, Douglas Walton, Scott Alexander
2. Key concepts that MUST appear: motte vs bailey positions, strategic equivocation, definitional retreat, burden of proof shifting, standpoint switching, commitment dodging, dialectical obligations, critical discussion stages, strategic maneuvering, fallacy as derailed strategic maneuvering, ambiguity exploitation, moving goalposts, no true Scotsman, weak man fallacy, bulverism, equivocation

I need to design entity types that capture all these concepts and their relationships.

Let me plan the entity types:

1. **motte_bailey_structures** - The core motte-bailey pairs
2. **positions** - Individual positions (motte or bailey)
3. **strategic_retreats** - Instances of retreat from bailey to motte
4. **equivocations** - Strategic ambiguity exploitation
5. **definitional_maneuvers** - How definitions are manipulated
6. **burden_shifts** - Burden of proof shifting instances
7. **dialectical_stages** - Tracking which stage violations occur in
8. **standpoint_switches** - When arguers switch positions
9. **commitment_records** - What commitments are made/dodged
10. **strategic_maneuvers** - Using van Eemeren's framework
11. **fallacy_instances** - Related fallacies (no true Scotsman, weak man, bulverism)
12. **ambiguity_exploitations** - How ambiguity is used
13. **goalpost_movements** - Moving goalposts instances
14. **dialectical_obligations** - What obligations are violated
15. **defense_patterns** - How positions are defended
16. **audience_effects** - How audience is manipulated
17. **textual_evidence** - Specific quotes/evidence


18. **rhetorical_shifts** - Tracking changes in argumentative strategy

Now I'll establish the ID naming conventions for each entity type to ensure consistency and traceability throughout the schema. Using prefixes like MB for motte-bailey structures, POS for positions, SR for strategic retreats, EQ for equivocations, DM for definitional maneuvers, BS for burden shifts, DS for dialectical stages, SS for standpoint switches, COM for commitment records, SM for strategic maneuvers, FAL for fallacy instances, AMB for ambiguity exploitations, GP for goalpost movements, DO for dialectical obligations, DP for defense patterns, AE for audience effects, TE for textual evidence, and RS for rhetorical shifts will allow me to quickly identify entity types and their relationships.
